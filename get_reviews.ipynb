Do you enjoy badass magic systems, strong FMCs, court politics, found family, sexy-broody-winged fae, steamy and secret romance, beautiful and cohesive world building, and phenomenally written character growth? No? Then you will HATE this series. Move along.Now, onto our review for those of you that have good taste.I just wanted to give Creon a hug throughout this whole book. He is such a great MMC and he and Em just complement each other so beautifully, even when they are butting heads and working through their trauma together. Their relationship really developed so much in this book; I am so impressed by how Lisette manages to hold on to just the right amount of tension and conflict without compromising the feeling of a realistic, loving relationship.I LOVED getting to see all of our beloved side characters in one place and taking on adventures together. The love! The hate! The drama! Oh, my. Plus, we get a fabulous new little member of the family and I am OBSESSED. This book had me gasping, crying, blushing, and stressed as fuck. The usual, beautiful emotional roller coaster Lisette writes into her books. And that ENDING. LISETTE, THAT ENDING. I will be nervously pacing until the next book releases. All that being said, go read the Fae Isles series because GOD you will want to get to this book ASAP.*Thank you to Lisette and her team for the chance to read an ARC of this book. This review is entirely my own*\n",

I absolutely adore Creon. I can't wait for the next book. But the stupidity of Em and Tared in this book was so frustrating that I didn't even enjoy reading it. The foreshadowing and symbolism weren't subtle, but Em was still acting like an idiot. I'm glad Creon finally stood up to her, but he was too passive for too long and I never understood how Em didn't realize she was treating him like shit and letting Tared treat him like shit too. There were also a couple things in the plot that were too predictable and just unsatisfying, like the crystal breaking and Em having to make that final choice at the end.\n",

            "Review 4: Reviewer: Bea27x, Review Count: 51, Followers: 15, Rating: 5, Date: December 20, 2023, Tags: fantasy, Likes: 17, Content: As was expected, I loved it. Compelling story and a lot of new discoveries, but what I'm gonna talk about is what always interest me the most, the characters.Emelin and Creon were really tearing at my heart for parts of this book. In the previous one a lot of Creon issues were talked about and here the focus was also on Emelin’s. I’m a big fan of , she is brave, capable, witty and clever and feels so very real, case in point in this book where we saw her make mistakes, she should have told the truth about her relationship with Creon, but I always understood why she felt like she couldn’t and really felt for her. She’s under a lot of pressure, she has the weight of the world on her shoulder and she’s struggling with the expectations people throw at her, trying her best and still feeling like she’s failing. For the first time in her life she has a family who loves her, a father who’s learning to listen to her and is proud of her, and she cares about their opinion, so she is afraid, afraid of their reaction, afraid to be a disappointment like she was to her horrible parents, afraid they will stop loving her, and she knows many wouldn’t understand or listen. I know her secrecy hurts Creon and she’s too concerned with pleasing others but I can’t blame her, she has a lifetime of ingrained strive to be what others want her to be that it’s difficult to overcame, and the people around her definitely don't help; she is made to feel like she was by her parents, judged, like she’s not what she is supposed to be, like she needs to act the part to please them, they don’t mean to do that, but they do, with their comments and behavior, so of course she doesn't feel like she can tell the truth and should be the one to bend back, even at the expense of her feelings and wants. By the end though she starts coming out of this cycle and to realize that maybe she can and should take into consideration herself, without letting other people dictate her life. She learns and grows as the story proceeds and it’s really beautiful to watch.Throughout the book Em feels too bad about everything to be properly angry so I’m furious on her behalf, with Tared most of all. I liked him in the previous books, but here I can’t stand him, because he makes all of it worst for Em. I know he cares about her, but his version of caring is suffocating, and sometimes it’s like after all his talk about Emelin being capable he’s doing his best to make her feel like she needs to be supervised. He acts like talking to Creon is a capital offense and Lord knows what will happen if he doesn't stick his nose in every breath Em takes, he gives her every reason to be reluctant of telling him the truth. And then dares to be angry! Not to mention the way him and Beyla treat her when they do find out, like Tared feelings are to be spared at all costs. I’m still pissed. Em may make mistakes but she’s young, he is hundreds of years old, he should be more mature. With his situation with Lyn too. Thank God for Lyn talking sense.Then there’s , my morally grey beloved, like Emelin I can’t help adoring him when he’s sweet, flirty and funny but also when he’s dangerous and dark. He suffered so much in his life, sacrificed so much, that I just want to hug him and for people to stop being horrible to him (they could never punish him more than he punished himself for the things he had to do) and for them to acknowledge all he’s done for others at great cost for himself. This brings me back yet again to Tared, and his behavior toward Creon… that actually made me hate him. I get that it’s not easy to make peace with old enemies, but even in the face of the things Tared now knows and evidence against what he thought, he still can’t let go of his preconceptions and his hate for Creon even a little bit, he’s determined to think the absolute worst and treats him like shit, no matter what he doesn’t want to change his mind. Creon sacrificed his voice for the lives of some of them, he saves Edored’s life, and Tared gets more angry, resentful and spiteful, tries to find the remarks that hurts the most and treats him even worst because of that?! That’s what he calls honor? Everyone was angry at Creon for his fight with Tared, but I’m 100% on his side. Creon may not be friendly with Tared but he’s not the one being vicious. It’s understandable why Creon wants to keep his façade and doesn’t want to expose himself with the Alliance, not when the only weak spot they know it’s still weaponized against him.  continue to be an amazing couple, they’re so cute, have such great banter, and understand each other better than anyone else. They have also some struggles and different opinions, but they love each other so much and when push comes to shove they always have each other’s back, so I know they will always be very much together and on the same side, and that’s what I want the most. It warms my heart to see how much Creon loves her, how in wonder he is of her, how much he believes in her, he would literally do anything for her. Em is the one with whom he can be the person he was never allowed to be before and they make each other so happy. In this book Em insecurities and the scars her parents left affect her relationship with Creon as well, hiding their relationship hurts them, especially Creon, and when all of his feelings come out his pain breaks my heart, and Emelin’s, that’s when she really understands that she can't keep making everyone else’s happiness her job, that she can make decisions for herself and Creon first, because he is the only person she can’t live without, just like he can't live without her. At the end she chooses to prioritize Creon, to do the one thing that means so much to him, that she was the only one to figure out means so much to him, because he means so much to her, not as a weapon first, but as the person he is, and I will defend her choice to the death.Also, maybe he can’t attack the Mother, but Creon is pretty freaking powerful even without that part of bound magic, he and Em work and fight brilliantly together already, she is more than capable of holding her own and he’s always there when she needs him, they will figure things out some other way.P. S. I love awkward father Agenor and his scenes with Em, I also kind of can’t wait for his reaction to Emelin and Creon.A big part of me really didn't want to finish this book because now I have to wait, and how is it possible to wait after that ending and Creon voice!\n",

Full of adventure, action and drama, and all manor of fantasy creatures, powers and lore, and at the heart of it, a beautiful love story that continues to own my heart. This is the third book of the series (not including the prequel novel, ), continuing Emelin’s story as a half fae/half human magic wielder, and part of the growing rebellion against the fae Mother who rules all with a ruthlessly powerful hand. Stuck in a hidden underground with a wonderfully mixed bunch, Emelin and her growing list of allies are planning to destroy the Mother once and for all, and restore the power and freedoms that she has stolen from all of the beings in their world. By her side is her lover Creon, the Mother’s son and feared former executioner who has rebelled and is now working with the allies to bring her down – even though he is still deeply distrusted by most. The relationship between Emelin and Creon is strong, passionate, and all consuming, but it’s also a secret. There is no way the face of the rebellion can be seen as being in a relationship with the Mother’s executioner, even if he has seemingly switched sides. Creon is still untrusted, and Emelin knows that if her allies knew she was in love with who they perceive as they enemy, their group could crumble. So, when a group is put together to embark on a trip to the mysterious ‘Continent’, where they plan to seek the gods themselves to ask for help in their quest, it’s with very mixed dynamics and one huge secret, which sets the scene for a bumpy ride ahead. The drama and excitement is high, and I loved the sense of adventure as we follow Emelin, Creon, and their friends (and some not-so-much-friends) on a journey filled with magic, danger, and a whole lot of emotional baggage. The interactions are sharp and witty, and vary from friendly banter to outright disdain, and I loved feeling like I was right in the thick of it with them. But in the middle of it all, Emelin and Creon are both struggling to keep their feelings for each other hidden, and under the stress of it all, cracks are starting to appear. It’s emotional and dramatic, and it’s frustrating at times, but it’s part of their journey. And as Emelin encounters mysteries and challenges, she learns and she grows, and I really loved watching her change so much as she faces the impossible, comes to terms with her powers, and has some pretty significant realisations about her own life, and her relationship with the man she loves so deeply. The romance is absolutely beautiful. Yes, they face challenges, but I never doubted Emelin and Creon’s bond, or their feelings for each other, and those difficult moments just make the love story all the more intense. There is such a deep connection between the two of them. They care for, support and accept each other without question, and whether they are laughing together, fighting together, or exploring their sizzling sexual chemistry, they are an absolute powerhouse, and I just love them!There are battles and intrigue, and though this is a long book, the storyline moves at a great pace. It’s exciting and engaging, and I was completely hooked from start to finish. The story twists and turns, and there’s so much going on, progressing the series storyline brilliantly and building to what is sure to be an epic confrontation. But how long is Emelin willing to live with a lie? And when she is forced to make life-changing decisions, will she follow her head, or her heart?Gah! It’s all happening, and I cannot get enough. I finished this book feeling absolutely breathless, and though it ends in a good place, I am desperate for more, and cannot wait for the series to continue.5 stars!\n",

I'm completely ruined because there's no way I can wait a reasonable amount of time for the next one. I will literally DIE!Creon and Em remain the centre of my entire universe and I can never have too much time in the company of those two. Finally, I'm so proud of the way the theme of self-sacrifice was dealt with in this book, I don't want to spoil a darn thing but this exploration remains a deeply personal highlight for me.

It's so unique and unlike anything I've seen before. Petition to re-introduce the Labyrinth in the final book please!I absolutely adore Creon to pieces, I could literally wax poetic about him for hours. I used to equally love Emelin, especially how sassy and badass she is, but I just... didn't in this book. She was too selfish here, only thinking about her friends and her reputation and making decisions that hurt my bae Creon. She wasn't even thinking how things would influence him, and taking him for granted. So honestly that part at the very end came as no surprise to me. Though she did make the right decision to me in the end, and I'm so excited about it and I can't wait to see how it continues!!\n",

Em turned into a spineless, watered down version of the Emelin we saw in books 1 &2. This book has no plot, storyline, meaning or purpose. I really liked books 1 & 2 and I had such high hopes for this one. Creon deserved better than what the author gave us. I felt like his rich and fun character from the previous books was totally missing in this book. All the world building from the previous books went to shit in this one. There was barely any use of color magic and don’t even get me started on sudden complex changes and shifts of the use of sign language without any explanation given. The only reason why I forced myself to finish this is because I still have slight hope the final book will make up for the lack of depth in this one.\n",

I’m so proud of Em! And now I have to wait for the next book 😭So, this one continues from the previous book, but this time we get to learn a bit more about Em and her insecurities and concerns, how she feels about basically the weight of the world on her shoulders and how she’s…not handling it 😅 and how Creon(oh how I love that Fae male! 🥰) is just always there no matter what. We also get to learn even more about some of the side characters and their pasts, especially Tared, Lyn, Nenya, Beyla, Naxi and Edored. And then of course the beautiful romance 🥰 Lisette has a way with romances, words and creating worlds! As always, I love the romance! Whenever it was just Em and Creon, it’s like everything was alright in the world and those two and their connection was just so beautiful and I couldn’t get enough of it! Whenever someone would pop into the scene I would get mad because I just wanted to read about those two 😂 Now, the reason I couldn’t give this 5 stars is because the characters were insufferable! This book stressed me out 😅 No one got along and yet no one seemed to really stand up for Creon, even Em and it was hard for me to read through those scenes. And I get they’re not going to immediately trust Creon, but guys! Come on! The way they treat him after everything they learn about him, not okay…I’m looking at you Tared! Tared is my least favorite character. I never really liked him when he first came into the picture and I really don’t after reading this. That alf needs an attitude check! And Creon didn’t make it easy, but he at least is trying!!! Lyn is also trying and Naxi is probably my other favorite character, a little scary, but such a fun and lovable character and her at least acknowledges Creon! And Em, my dear Em, how you’re handling this relationship could be better, because I need it to work out for Creon! The 4 stars are ultimately for Creon. I love that Fae so so much! Seriously one of the best book boyfriends ever and I just adore his sassy, broody, melodramatic Fae-ness that he is 🥰 Oh and Agenor. I hope that family truly becomes a family again one day 🥰 I seriously don’t know how I can wait for the next book because things are gonna happen and it’s gonna be crazy! Thank you so much Lisette for the free digital copy to read 🥰 All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n",

I was continually annoyed by her lack of backbone and choices to put her public image front and center before her relationship with Creon. Yet she was incapable of understanding why Creon also had a public image he wanted to keep separate from who he was with her. Grrrrrr. This “found family” trope was definitely lacking, due to their nosiness and persistence in dictating who Emelin is and what she should do. However, I love Creon. He holds this book together. The half demon just keeps taking the hits and getting back up. He deserves the world, and if he thinks thats Emelin, then she needs to wise up and start putting him first.\n",

Okay this WHOLE review is spoilers because I cannot handle it. First off, that ENDING!!! Umm. How long exactly do I have to wait for the next book?!?! His voice! Ahh!! Second, was I slightly annoyed with Em for 70% of this book? Yes. Was she being super disrespectful to Creon and his feelings? Yes, yes she was. But I'm hoping this ending means the next book will move forward with less dumb blubbering from her and more kickass badassery. Thirdly, did I want to punch Tared in the throat several times? Yes. Yes I did. Honestly, I get why Em felt like she was ruining things but realistically, he dug his own grave over and over again. And he was a total asshat, not only to Creon but basically everyone! I am OBSESSED with this series though. And I loved the increase in spice, the continued mystery behind her mother, and the playful moments between Em and Creon. I lived for the moments in this book when Creon finally stopped forcing his mask and just was himself in front of the others with Em. Their confusion and disbelief was fun to read about. OverallStory ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Spice 🌶️🌶️🌶️Audio 🚫 read on KUOk here's my Synopsis for when the next book comes out with✨ HEAVY Spoilers ✨♦️♦️SPOILERS AHEAD ♦️♦️This book ended with our rag-tag group going to the Cobalt Court which is where the mother hid all the bindings. The bindings are tied to items and in this case are these delicate glass orbs. If broken the bindings are unable to return both the stolen magic and the \"other\" thing stolen such as Tared's memories of his parents or Creon's voice. Ultimately Creon's binding is recovered by Em and when she goes to return his gift and magic the commander of the Mothers army manages to get it broken. In a last ditch attempt Em has to choose for Creon, his voice or his magic. Her companions urge her to choose the magic so they can win the war. But Em ultimately chooses his voice, stating that she needs to make good choices like the God who blessed her advised. Also, Creon had a whole speech about being used and seen as a weapon but Em doesn't see him that way, so choosing his voice over his power is super meaningful. The whole book she struggles with making choices for herself and her happiness so this moment is a cultivation of that theme coming to pass. And right before they get to the court she and Creon have a bit of a fight where he basically gives her an ultimatum, stating that whatever she tells her friends about their relationship he will take as truth. This is because she feels responsible for the rift between Tared and Lyn and suggests she just say Creon and her broke up to keep the peace. And it pushes him too far. Another thing to mention is that during this book the goddess Zera blesses her with additional magic. So in addition to color magic she also gains magic to control motion, minds and shield/mirror magic. These magics are drawn from textures rather than colors. This magic makes her almost, if not more powerful than Creon and rivals the Mother who possesses the same powers. These powers were used to bind people, and the only way to break binds is using this magic. Meaning she can also make binds too. This makes her godsworn like her dad and she gains a bird familiar too. There's a lot of conflict with gaining allies due to the association with Creon. Part of the reason she was hiding their relationship is because it would've made the possibility of allies from the Nymphs and Phoenix's impossible. But the ending suggests she has finally taken Creon's words about her being the Queen of this revolution to heart.\n",

I love how much they communicate and care about each other.Yet, as much as I loved it, one point of the plot really pissed me off.We follow the story through Em's eyes and because it's a romance, we like Creon. So when Tared and his cousin act like complete pricks, insult him at every turn, and then Creon finally talks back and everyone blames him? Everyone comes off as unfair and unkind and doesn't deserve Creon. Don't get me wrong, I love every scene between Em and Creon when they are together, but she almost didn't defend him toward her \"family\" (really? Are we supposed to like them? Only Lyn is the least bit interesting in this group).Of course Tared's reason for hating him seems good. The problem is that we are TOLD not SHOWN every horrible things Creon did. So it's really hard to sympathyse with Tared. Even more when we learn that Creon took his victim's pain AND saved the group's life and they don't act even a little bit grateful.Honestly, seeing how nasty and useless (yes, because when Tared's cousin is dying, who does he calls for help? You guessed it, Creon. And he still doesn't even say thanks) they all were, I might enjoyed the book better if they weren't in it. So Creon is expected to win their war and save everyone with Em all the while being treated like shit by everyone?By the way, are we supposed to like Tared? To me he is just a secondary character that is forced into the story with no real purpose. He is less powerful than Creon, so why he is the one training Em is beyond me. We have no reason to like him. I think the author wanted this group to feel like Em's found family but failed to make me like them.Basically, I love the book, but hate how the author wants me to think it's completely normal that everyone except Em is nasty toward Creon without showing me it is justified.EDIT : I'm so glad Em did this choice in the end. Fuck these secondary characters for daring to ask anything from Em and Creon after how they treated him.\n",

I loved the histories explored as the main characters traverse the abandoned and deadly magical lands of the continent. As I read this book it felt as though the author skillfully extracted my inner essence from it’s safe confines to feel every hurt, every joy, every moment of longing, love, and despair that our main characters experience and endure. It was both beautiful and soul wrenching.The emotional tension and angst that builds between the love interest and main female character is perfectly interwoven into the plot, and is at times, absolutely infuriating as they are forced to conceal their love from family, allies, and friends. The intensity of the longing that I felt is a rarity in the third installment of a series. With the evolving nature of the romance, the author perfectly conveys the difficulties and risks of emotional vulnerability and intimacy between the main characters.Thankfully, there are brief moments of reprieve from that concealment, and those moments are utterly consuming and filled with an intense and primal passion. I audibly gasphed  at the end! I highly recommend this steamy fae romance to fantasy, romance, and fantasy romance readers!My most genuine and sincerest thanks to Lisette Marshall for having me on your ARC team for Ruins of Sea and Souls.\n",

Easing back into this world and the characters was fun and simple. I forgot how funny Edored is with his brutish charm. And how could I forget, Cactus! 🌵I love Em and Creon’s connection, it’s stabby and sweet! The unique magic system that the author has created is epic. Using color is so different and the way she removes colors to create different colors is so neat. I also loved how the author expanded on the existing magic in this book. Would love to see how light plays into the color magic in the next book.🔴Red for destruction.🟡Yellow for change.🔵Blue for healing.I loved watching Em and Creon connect and dive deeper into the issues in their relationship. The fact that Em was able to speak her truth about what she wanted and that Creon encouraged her to do that was really neat.

No major writing errors that I can’t overlook. A few minor spelling mistakes, and perhaps a few too many uses of the phrase “rock hard thighs”. Truly no notes.*Minor Spoilers*As for the story, the author chose to go in an *interesting* direction. If the intention was to take the FMC from smart ass, determined, and relatively capable woman (with maybe a touch of naive love sickness) to an insecure waffling weirdo with an insufferable inner monologue then ✅. If the underground and “found family” characters were meant to go from wise and supportive yet cautious to downright petty and immature (seriously how can every 100s year old immortal in this book become just as if not more ridiculous than a 20 year old) then ✅.The most satisfying part of this book was when Creon basically told Emelin to shit or get off the pot. I initially thought he was up to his usual brooding man antics, but really, if you think about it for like 2 minutes, it’s a miracle he didn’t lose it sooner. If my partner treated me like I was a dirty shameful secret to their family who also treated me like I was a dirty shameful person, I too, would self destruct 💀 Oh and somebody needs to beat Tareds ass (besides Creon)Anyway I’m gonna read the last book because I’m too invested now to stop 🤭\n",

And there are many reasons why. First, I should say I’m absolutely in love with Creon’s character. I haven’t been this obsessed with a MMC in a long time, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. But the rest is hugely problematic for me - a gigantic let down after how enthusiastically I devoured the first two books. This book… if I’m not ready to yank Em around by her hair for continuing to push Creon away and disregard his feelings over and over and over and over and over and over again… I’m dying of boredom from the interminably long sections of explanatory dialogue. I didn’t even enjoy reading it, and once it was over I just felt hollow. Like I lost hours of my life. There were many sections I skimmed because I just couldn’t take the glacial pacing. And this entire book was so repetitive, it was clear Em didn’t learn anything in the least. And she has no care for anyone’s feelings but her own, despite what she blabs on and on about to no end. I understand Em is young. But that’s no excuse for her behavior or acting so childish and selfish. Once? That’s just good writing. Twice? Now we are in real suspense. Three times? Bordering on exasperating. But I lost count of how many times Em said she would tell everyone about their relationship “tomorrow” or made another lame excuse for why she kept Creon at arms length, hiding their relationship. Unacceptable, lazy and repetitive. Did I mention repetitive, yet? Annoying, isn’t it?When I realized that the fourth book is months away from releasing, I was distraught. At first. Until I read this book. When it eventually comes out, I may read it for Creon alone. But even he may not be enough to convince me to continue down this painful path. I was so excited to finally find another good series and now I’m heartbroken I may never finish it.\n",

This book includes:- Fae, nymphs, demons, familiars, phoenixes, and more.- Unique magic system. - Powerful FMC.- Morally gray MMC Prince of Death who communicates with sign language.- Grumpy x Sunshine.- Found family.- Political maneuvering.- Warfare / strategy.The romance between Emelin (FMC) and Creon (MMC) has gone from slow burn to raging flame, but they still face their share of adversity in their quest to defeat The Mother. RoSaS is constantly alternating between conflict, resolution, and new discoveries that kept me so engrossed I couldn't put it down for two days straight. I was hard pressed to find a place to pause my reading because I just kept needing MORE information and to see how things played out. The banter is S Tier and I found myself smiling and laughing throughout the whole book; as well as having my heart stuck in my throat with worry and dread.Lisette has made me fall head over heels with all these characters and this series has become of my favorites.

This is the first book in the series where I have found the perfect connection to the characters, and I am here for it! I feel so bad for Creon and how he is treated, especially with all he's already been through, my heart melted just that much more for him. Everytime he was pushed away, I felt that like a hollowing deep in my guts. Once again, this book contains some really unique magic, with additions that we haven't seen in the previous books. It really put an interesting spin on things, and I think I'm slowly starting to see how they can defeat the Mother. The way Em and Creon fight together is beautiful, and really, they should know by now that when they join forces, nothing seems impossible. I love the character growth in this story, which when added to the plot, world-building, unique magic system, and character connection, it's not hard to see why this is my favourite book so far in the Fae Isles series, I just loved it!

But what is that they say about publicity, any publicity is good publicity? I guess that is the same with books. If you write it well enough to feel any sort of feelings, that is just good writing.First and foremost, is it possible to write a Fae book without a miscommunication trope? Well, take that and multiply it by three books and you’ve got a firm grasp of this series. Listen, I get it. It is Fae writing 101 to have some sort of miscommunication in the story to get the plot going, but by the end of book one we should have started to see some progression. However, it was very drug out in book two. Seriously, by the end I was like ok put the stick down, that horse is dead. Once again, I had high hopes that by book three things would finally get moving..Book three was even worse. At the very least, the two main characters should have experienced some sort of growth in that department. But couple that with the fact that every single one of the important side characters were also dealing with constant miscommunication…it was just very painful to read at times. The only thing that kept me pushing through was the fact that I really like each one of the characters. The author does such a good job at making you love each one. They are all integral and you can’t help but be invested. The author really knows how to build up relationships, romantic or otherwise. Albeit they are completely toxic at this point, but I digress. The biggest problem was the heavy foreshadowing and the deliberate avoidance of that. The FMC for instance, it couldn’t have been spelled out more clearly (and repeatedly) that ANY of her relationship directions she was taking was not only wrong but wouldn’t withstand; and yet she refused to address or fix it. Just kept digging a deeper hole, it’s like she wanted to bury herself in it. There were so many times I wanted to put this book down. Actually, throw it in frustration is more like it. But I couldn’t. I was in it. I love the story. I love the world building. I love the magic system. I read a lot of fantasy, and it is hard to find a fae fantasy series that is unique these days. I love everything about the bigger picture of this story. The plot itself is so interesting. Despite my aversion to the character development, it is a very well written story. The cliff hanger at the end of book three may have been predictable, but it was necessary. I get why it lead to that point and the symbolism behind it.So here I am, in a choke hold, begging for book four. I may be a masochist, or just a hopeless fool, but I’m once again putting blind faith in the author. I am basically begging for it all to be worth it in the final book. I can’t NOT finish this series. I have to know what happens. Bringing me back to my point, despite every painful moment of this journey-I couldn’t stop reading. With that, I’d say that it’s good writing on behalf of the author. Overall, I’d give this series a 3.6/5 with a 3/5 for spice.\n",

There is a ton of climax here regarding personal relationships. Some things finally come to a head, and it gets dicey.I felt that at some parts the story dragged. I think there is more personal drama between the characters that I didn’t love and so the story and plot kind of came second to the drama. I really like this series. I want to know what happens. I am utterly dedicated to seeing this through. I really just wish that the plot stayed as strong through all the personal and relationship issues. I also feel like the author would add a spicy scene to build you up for moments relating to the plot. By the last spicy scene in this book I was feeling like the passion between the MCs was for build-up and not relationship development/personal development. I also saw the inevitable conclusion of that scene coming from the moment it began. The second book of this series really surprised me. I didn’t see some of the plot twists, the action was page turning, and the romance was real. With the third book, I just kind of felt like it was forced. The plot is so good and it really only gets stronger in terms of the adventure with this book. This book, regardless of what I’ve said so far, was really strong in developing the plot for the series itself including the next installment. There are some really critical things that happen here but I can’t help but wish the inner monologue and the drama of relationships wasn’t such a key stone of this books plot. For me it just overshadowed the brilliance of the plot itself and the writing of the series so far. I could say so much more but I want to just end this by saying I’m not disappointed regardless of the flaws. This isn’t my favorite book of the series, but it is nonetheless a really great story and there is some strong building to come from this. Be warned: Cliff. Hanger. Happy Reading Friends xx\n",

The journey continues where Creon and Emelin have to gather allies to help them defeat the villain – The Mother. With the help of Em’s new friends from the Underground, they are on a quest to search for a way to defeat The Mother and it’s not gonna be easy. I like seeing how the author didn’t just focus on Emelin and Creon, but also letting the readers to know more about the side character’s past like Lyn, Tared, Em’s father, etc. Although, I felt slightly frustrated with the way Emelin is choosing to handle all these problems like her power, responsibility as the only unbound mage and her relationship with Creon for the most part of the story. As you can already tell my favorite character is Creon and I felt so disappointed by how the other characters still treated Creon badly even after knowing the truth to some of his actions. He needs more love and I hope he’ll get more of that in the next book. One of the reason I really like this book is because it has one of the scene that I’ve been waiting for since book 1 and it finally came true!I can’t wait to see what happens next after that unexpected ending because things are far from being over.

Bei so vielen witzigen und auch herzzereißenden Zitaten kann ich mich nicht wirklich auf einen Liebling festlegen.In zwei Tagen hatte ich RoSaS durch, was vielleicht auch an der Handlung lag. Diese ist zwar nicht immer mit viel Action geladen, dafür ist sie auf ihre eigene Weise spannend und abwechslungsreich gestaltet.Meine Gedankenwelt drehte sich beim Lesen hauptsächlich um Creon und Em, die ich gerne einmal geschüttelt hätte, damit sie mit sich selbst, gegenseitig und ihren Freunden gegenüber im Reinen sind - einfach weil manche Dinge ziemlich frustrierend (aber auf eine gute Weise) zu lesen waren. Den Sinn dahinter habe ich auch verstanden und nachvollziehen können; nämlich damit die Charaktere über sich hinauswachsen und nach ihren Wünschen leben können, nur haben dadurch meine Nerven beim Lesen etwas gelitten.Über das Magie-System möchte ich nicht zu viel verraten, nur dass ich so etwas bisher noch nicht gelesen habe und es Farben beinhaltet. Kreativ und originell trifft es wohl sehr gut.Bevor ich zum Ende des Buches komme, möchte ich noch kurz die ganzen Nebencharaktere loben, die sich für mich wie reale, atmende Menschen (oder so ähnlich), die auf Papier verewigt wurden, anfühlen. Sie besitzen alle so viel Hintergrundgeschichte, eine Portion Tragik und ganz viel Persönlichkeit, was ich sehr liebe.Und nun zum Ende, was ich - überraschenderweise - auch geliebt habe. Es ist eine Mischung aus Folter und Erleichterung für mich als Leser. Wie ein Stück Schokolade, das ich unbedingt wollte und wovon ich nun nicht genug bekomme. Es endet extrem spannend, aber wenigstens schenkt Lisette Marshall uns eine langersehnte Auflösung.Ich weiß auf jeden Fall, dass Em und Creon mit zu meinen Lieblingen zählen und für mich genauso mit ACOTAR mithalten können. Der vierte Band kann nicht früh genug kommen.\n",

As part of Lisette's Street team I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review.This series has everything I love, a morally grey hero, and an even more morally grey (so grey its almost black) love interest. The chemistry between the two is electric and beautiful and I bought into every second of the relationship.The FMC faces the consequences a life of prioritising others and believing her worth is measured by how valuable she is to others. Struggling between being who she is expected to be and who she wants to be, Em's journey of self identity and growth is heartbreaking at times, and so reflective of so many of our own lives, making her that much more relatable and loveable. Creon and Em both have their flaws and my favourite part of this is that they not only see eachother's flaws, but they actively love even the darkest parts of eachother.Lisette's world building and story setting is phenomenal throughout, and the world she creates is full of beauty and magic and draws you in from the get go. The found family aspect is so sweet and so reflective of a true family and the way that Lisette manages to capture the complexities of all the different kinds of relationship is truly masterful.My only complaint? That ending. How could you 😢 I will be waiting impatiently for the next book.\n",

Ruins of Sea and Souls is the third book in the Fae Isles quartet. I'm going to be resuming my thoughts here and come back to do a more detailed review in a few days as I'm still processing. This book is not what I was expecting but in a good way, we get to see a lot more characters interactions, we see more of the land, we learn much more of the history and about the powers. But especially more about the binding which I found so intriguing and at the end of the day my thoughts came back to Ally and Agenor in the prequel. I got really sad when we got to see how the gods had fallen. What really made me melt was Alyra. I can't say any more without getting into spoilers so, all I'm going to say is, I'm very much looking forward to the final book in this quartet.\n",

There were parts of this book I really enjoyed, like exploring more of the magic system and Emelin gaining more powers, the battle on the ship, and of course, Creon 😏. However, the repeated arguments in Emelin’s head, with Creon and Tared, and the side characters’s opinions on Creon were frustrating and tiring. I thought these things would be resolved by now... Seeing how this ended, there’s still going to be conflict in the last book, but I’m hoping there will be less arguments among the characters and more fights to defeat the Mother.\n",

Also this latest installment has a little bit of everything: banter, pining, hope, fear.RoSaS follows Em as she tries to navigate being a\"chosen one\" symbol and her relationship with Creon, a connection her found family finds worrisome. I kind of loved this subplot of Em learning to balance her own wants and needs with saving the world. Also, Em and Creon just work really well together.This cast of characters shines! Also, I really like the complicated dynamics and found family that the main crew has. I'm very curious to see how some of these complex relationships get resolved.All in all, RoSaS is a fantastic addition to the Fae Isles Series and I'm eagerly anticipating the next one - especially given that cliffhanger!Many thanks to Lisette Marshall for an eARC of this novel!\n",

Are we even supposed to like him? He has not done anything that has made him remotely likable. The way that he treated Emelin like she is naive and didn't know what she was doing at all times made me want to rip my hair out. There is nothing more infuriating than a man that treats a woman like she is stupid. Bold of him to treat Emelin the way that he did when he literally binded himself to someone who explicitly told him that she did not want to be binded to someone for all of eternity. it's giving... abusive? And the fact that he forbids Lyn to talk about her feelings on that situation is so messed up. Also, what happened to the woman in books 1 and 2? Why was Emelin so insecure all of the sudden and why did she care so much about what everyone thinks about her (especially when it comes to Creon). Creon deserved so much better from her in this book. Watching her just take every nasty thing that her \"found family\" said about her and Creon was insufferable. Especially when there was literally no reason for them to hate him and much as they did because he has proven time and time again that he is not the villain that everyone thinks he is. Also, if your so called \"family\" is judging you and making you feel guilty for loving who you want to love, then THEY ARE NOT YOUR FAMILY. it was so clean that Emelin desperately wanted a family-like relationship with these people and was just taking their horrible behavior so she can have just that. Her inability to defend the person that she claims to love just made my heart hurt for Creon. Like obviously treating him like you would touch him with a 6ft pole is not going to make him feel confident about your relationship with him??? I'm glad he finally put his foot down. Hopefully Emelin will get her head out of her ass in the next book and tell her \"found family\" to stfu. I will be reading the next book because I genuinely loved the first and second books and I want to read about Creon's voice but this one was so disappointing.\n",

THIS BOOK!This book, along with the previous one in the series, has achieved something that few have: It kept me interested in the series even though the protagonists are already together. Because they have problems... Like any couple in the world! And I was tired of reading books where, once they're together, the author completely forgets about the couple and only focuses on the war. This book has a war plot underlying everything, but its main focus remains on the relationship between the protagonists. The author definitely gives both of them and each of the supporting characters a chance to shine. We learn to love some and hate others, ALL of them are morally gray, just like probably every person in this world.The book generates all kinds of emotions: anguish, uncertainty, happiness, and above all, the feeling of wanting MORE MORE MORE. Seriously, I can't stop recommending it to everyone!Something else I really like: The sex scenes don't feel forced. I've read so many books where the author writes those scenes that it seems like they're only doing it to fill pages. That's not the case here.Now, SPOILERS:Emelin frustrated me a lot in this book, but I completely understood her. She was caught in a big dilemma, and she's still very young. She has already lost her previous family and doesn't want it to happen again. Fortunately, in the end, she made the right choice (according to me) and choosed the one who has always supported her throughout her journey.Regarding Tared: I HATE HIM. Sorry, but I can't find another word to describe how I feel about him. I never liked his character, but this book sealed the deal for me. His attitude towards Emelin is horrible, constantly judging her for what she does or doesn't do, watching over her as if she were a little child. And his attitude towards Lyn doesn't sit well with me either... You might hate me for this, but I find him somewhat abusive. He bonded himself to her and didn't inform her, and now she's basically forbidden from having a romantic relationship because otherwise, he will literally die... well, let him die then! Ok, but seriously he needs to catch a grip.Anyway, do yourselves a favor and read this book series.\n",

I was proud of him when he stood up to Em when she had taken his love for granted. He deserves everything and more. Just when I think he can't get any more perfect than he already is, he surprises me even more. Creon is my most favorite morally gray misunderstood book boyfriend of all time. No one can take his place. One thing I can't deny is the way Em and Creon save each other back in a fight, and how much they fulfil each other. She soothes him by understanding his fears, and he makes her understand she is not a pawn. She is a queen, and she shouldn't bow down to anyone because the rest of the world needs her. Creon was proving with his actions he doesn't mean anyone harm.𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐚 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭.

She is one of those people who made this book worth reading. After meeting Zera Em could understand other people's grief, their motivation behind their choices. Zera also made her understand just because she can feel empathy and grief for others doesn't mean she can't get angry at them. There are other important things she has taught her which I can't reveal.𝐀𝐥𝐲𝐫𝐚I freaking adore Alyra. She is so feisty and so pretty. She cracks me up. Em was thoughtful, naming her Alyra.

I never thought I would say this, but Em has lost her spine in this book totally utterly. It isn't until the end she found her spine back. I was tremendously disappointed in her. Just when I started to see she was trying to redeem herself, she would go up another notch to frustrate and anger me. To the point where I truly thought she didn't deserve Creon. Yes, it was that bad. I'm not mad at her because of her self-doubt. Even though throughout the whole book, we get to see her inner turmoil repeatedly. It was needed for her self growth. But the repeating wasn't needed. 𝐋𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬𝐧'𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝.I understand she has trauma and doesn't want to lose the family and friends she just found. I also understand nobody wants to be criticized as a witless 20 years old girl, and she would rather not fan the flame of rumors the queen has spread. But what I'm really mad at her about is she never for once, stood up for Creon. She did it once with Agenor even that was at the end. She criticized Creon just like everyone else. She never stood up to Tared's vicious taunts, glare, provocation towards Creon. Just when Creon would answer any of those provocations she would get mad at him. She shoved him aside every time just to make Tared happy. Not seeing it was hurting him. She acted like Creon was her dirty secret and their relationship was something to be ashamed of. In this book, she was brilliant at being foolish. And I blame Tared for forcing her to feel like this. 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 is someone who I would be pleased to see die in a slow, torturous death by the hands of Creon. It doesn't matter how many sacrifices Creon has made and how much he has suffered over and over, and it also doesn't matter what Creon has done for the alliance without ever bragging about it. All Tared cares about his alf heart and precious Lyn. He has hindered every decision of Em. He has made her feel like some inadequate child who doesn't know what she wants. It's like he is her medieval father. The alliance and the family treat her as a weapon. Tared is toxic and abusive. He bonded to Lyn and doesn't even tell her. I feel bad for Lyn now she can't even choose her mate. If he dies without Lyn let him die.𝐁𝐞𝐲𝐥𝐚 is the blandest person in this book. She is vain. All she does is glaring at Creon and wander around. She doesn't bring anything much to the table, just like Nexi. At least Nexi defends Creon.𝐓𝐡𝐲𝐬𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐚 is not someone who she seems to be. This book ended in cliffhanger. What a beautiful cliffhanger it is!! Which also left me bewildered and tongue-tied. Even though I knew what was going to happen, it still left me shocked, and it's a good kind of shock. Because we get what we have been waiting for since the first book. Am I looking forward to read the next book? That would be hella yes!!!\n",

Damnit three months… fucking hell I lost her birthday… I love that in this book we don’t have repetitive sex scenes, yeah they fuck a lot and thank gods that every time they fuck we don’t have a chapter of only fucking because this could be too repetitive, instead sometimes we have a real good sex full of details and others we have sex that is fast yes but still fulfilling enough to not get repetitive.Damnit shit will hit the fan in astronomically proportions…I’m feeling it, Em doesn’t has the girl balls to tell everyone of her relationship with Creon because The Mother raised some dumb rumor about a silly half Fae that the Silent Death has under his fingers and if before Em didn’t had the courage to tell her new family about Creon? Now things are fucked because the other races don’t believe they should join the fight against The Mother…damnit so in their travel guess what?Em is fucking up trying to hide her feelings for Creon, but the problem is… our guy is dramatic and sensible and… the Alves aren’t with bad intentions they’re like this and Em is family so they think they’re protecting their little sister and…shit everything is a mess.Well knowing a Goddess is surprisingly open minding… I’ll use it in my life hahaha. Was reading s book before that instead of the human girl to be ruthless like her vampire king father that loved her and taught all her life how to survive, she started empathizing with the humans and that made the book so fucking boring because I don’t fucking understand and I have really little empathy for a lot of things…yeah me and Naxi are sisters in it hahaha but this book?when Em took the grief of the world? When she undoubtedly understood her friends and enemies sorrow?that was wonderfully writed because made sense for me to understand…and damn this book is a motherfucking masterpiece, made even me think about my own sorrows… this was really open minding…Damn the new concepts of magic… fucking hell this is what I call a world building!!!I love how well Creon and Em learned to deal with each other weaknesses, they’re so different from the first book, I’m so damn proud of them hahaha Em is the best dealing with Creon’s dramatic tendencies and he is the best dealing with the waves of low esteem she has every time she has to make a hard choice, they’re so in sync it’s damn beautiful to see, when fighting together? Fucking hell that was art hahaha they’re far from perfect but they still try to understand each other and it’s what matters, that you try.Damnit things are really a mess because Em hadn’t the girl balls to fucking tell about her relationship with Creon and now Tared saw they together in the worst moment possible and things are going to hell, shit hit the damn fan and no one is going to be clean again… I’m even starting to panick like Em because damn everything is a fucking mess.This book… oh Gods this book is … purfec … I’m without words and damn me to the pits because I thought this was the last one and now I’m going through a hell of a book hangover …The world building? The characters development and backgrounds? It’s sooooo purfect!!! Em and Creon they’re definitely my couple goals because even being imperfect they’re so terrible perfect to each other… I’m dying a terrible death because instead I thought this damn series was complete… fuck me sideways… I’ll die, die, die… waiting for the next one oh Goddess I knew things weren’t going to solve themselves in just this one but damn men!!!\n",

Things are still uneasy with her connection to the infamous Silent Death but Em is the one person with capacity to do something, to save everyone, and every action she takes, every relationship she has is met with scrutiny. As the pressure to save the world and her need to hide her relationship with Creon weigh on her, she must make a stand between duty to the realm and duty the the male she loves.Em and Creon are perfect together and I spend so much time wanting them to just have time along to truly be. Em is feeling the pressure of the world on her shoulder and it tugged on my heart strings to see her struggle but her growth over the course of this series has been great. The confidence she builds here is key to her growing into the role she must take up. I will say she took a little bit too much time deciding on one thing but I did understand the pressure she was under. Creon continued to be the most wonderful morally grey fae male that I absolutely adore. He is fierce and hold no punches in doing what he must to protect the ones he loves. I've always been a fan of the misunderstood male characters and to see Creon slowly be understood was a raw experience that endeared me further. Creon stays in the shadows for Em to shine and I lived for it. This book contains spice - I would say 3 spicy peppers out of 5 spicy peppers. The characters are in an established relationship for the beginning of the novel but their romance is forbidden so we get a lot of awesome sexual tension and secret rendezvous. I felt the romance was the perfect level of sweet, banter, and spice. I will say the tension of keeping the relationship did feel like it dragged on too long but the moments in between were a delight.In terms of world and plot, the world continued to be developed in a way that continues to grab my attention. The lore, evolving magic system, and the exploration of new territories enriches this series and I am invested in seeing where it goes. This series has one of the most fascinating magic systems with the use of colour that I have read to date and I am amazed how each book continues to shape it in new lights. The story itself is well paced with action, war intrigue, slices of life, tension, and discovery. It has all the things that grab fantasy readers and it is balanced with a romance that grips the readers. I do recommend getting a refresher as there a lot of characters to keep track of and some new ones that I felt added to the series a lot. The side characters challenged Creon and Em and encourage them to act which helped keep the story smoothly run while also providing some of those funny moments we need to break things up. I devoured this book in a day.If you are looking for a fantasy romance series with beautiful magic, tragic misunderstood morally grey males, a strong chosen one female, and a growing war against the realm this series has it all...and its on KU! Thank you to Lisette for this ARC!\n",

I found myself delaying reading this book since finishing the previous one due to the sheer length of it and knowing that I’d be immediately sucked into it and essentially have to live off-grid until I finished it.As expected, the world building and descriptive settings were rich and delicious! Marshall has such a talent of creating such complex settings and characters with ease and simplicity rather than defecting to convoluted explanations for the reader to make sense of things as I’ve seen in alternative fantasy novels.I have to say each and every character we follow has stolen a piece of my heart which made the challenges and arguments they faced all the more engaging, with an honourable mention for Naxi - can’t wait to hopefully get to know her more! Though Tared has been testing my patience. You’re starting to sound like a broken record boy, and the guilt trips towards Em felt a bit gas-lighty too. Please let him get a grip soon.I do have to air some of my frustrations over Emelin and Creon’s passivity in this particular book. For the first time in this series I felt a disconnect and slight apathy toward their relationship. Emelin was such a force to be reckoned with and has previously had to come to realisations rather painfully but then shown strength of character when deciding to take action regardless of outside opinions. Her decision to conceal her relationship after realising the pain it caused Creon, along with Zera’s echoing warning not to take love for granted over and over again, despite her true desires, felt slightly torturous.The Creon in this book also seemed to revert to Em’s glorified arm candy (I thought we got past his inferiority complex in the previous book during his self imposed exile spent wallowing). The two fiery and brave characters whose dynamic I’d come to love seemed to lose my attention in their scenes alone together, due to the frustration of it all. They’ve fought harder battles to be together just to roll over for Em’s fear of the Alliance’s inevitable judgement. Creon’s “silence” through his discomfort with it all seemed to stem from his need to placate Em, despite the fact that their relationship history has shown their compatibility is strengthened due to their differences in character and desire to challenge each other. Their relationship in this book felt like that friend who asks for your advice despite both of you knowing full well they won’t act on it. After the first few attempts to get through to them, it just feels like flogging a dead horse. You don’t get to be the victim of your own choices Em, and run to Creon each time for reassurance from the one person you’re hurting more than yourself - she’s giving off TOXIC. The intimacy and private conversations therefore felt a bit redundant and more like checking the box for the appropriate percentage of alone time they should be afforded.I have to admit I may be overly critical as Lisette’s writing is so phenomenal that I’ve honed in on the smaller details. Though this book was undeniably breathtaking and that cliffhanger!!! My heart may not recover in time, but I’m eagerly awaiting the next one. Thank you Lisette for sharing your talent. I will deeply miss living in the world you've built in the meantime :)\n",

My favorite of the series so far in terms of story and pacing. A lot more action than in the other two and I was so happy about that. As with the other two books, a few things annoyed me with the characters.. I really understand everyone's trauma and trauma responses - I feel for all of them and accept that they are flawed in such a realistic way. But I do desperately want to break a few noses (iykyk) throughout this book, especially Tared and Emelin. Creon was the sensible one for once and I honestly think his reactions were so realistic and made so much sense, whereas Em and Tared could have benefitted from a few slaps. Aaaand a conversation or two. But I really did enjoy this novel and loved the places we visited - we moved around a lot more and it was so awesome to get to see more of the world. It was also nice to get to know more about their history; I think the author does a really good job at giving us stories and showing us things a little at a time instead of just explaining the entire concept of the world in the first book. It's very satisfying to figure more out along the way and continue to get more bits and pieces throughout the series. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\n",

To understand the events you should have read the previous volumes. I would rather describe this part as the series before the storm. We know what big things are about to happen and Em and her friends will play a big part in that. In this volume it was about, among other things, that she learns to train her powers and at the same time we get to know the alliance better. It was interesting to see how different dynamics meet and what used to be friends can't stand each other anymore but still have to work together. Especially Creon, who really i felt sorry for. On the one hand, I could understand the others, but on the other hand, I just wanted them to accept him. There have also been some interesting developments throughout the book that will likely play a role in the next part. It was pretty quiet here and sometimes it dragged on a bit, but I'm a fan of Em and Creon and again the author managed to inspire me with both of them. All in all I would say that we are slowly getting closer to war and I am curious what to expect. From time to time it took me a bit to find my way into the story, but I still liked the characters and the love story and found it exciting to get to know the others better. I can't wait to see what's in store for me and can only recommend that you read the story of Em & Creon believe me you will love it.DE: Danke an die Autorin die mir ein ARC zu Verfügung gestellt hat meine Meinung wurde davon nicht beeinträchtigt.Es geht weiter mit der Geschichte rund um Emelin und Co. Um die Ereignisse zu verstehen sollte man die vorherigen Bände gelesen haben. Diesen Teil würde ich eher bezeichnen als die Reihe vor dem Sturm. Wie wissen das was großes auf uns zukommen wird um Em und ihre Freunde eine große Rolle dabei spielen wird. In diesem Band ging es darum das sie unter andrem lernt ihre Kräfte zu trainieren und gleicher zeit lernen wir auch besser die Allianz kennen. Es war Interessant zu sehen wie verschieden Dynamik aufeinander treffen und die mal freunde waren sich jetzt nicht mehr ausstehen können aber dennoch zusammen arbeiten müssen. Besonders Creon der einen wirklich leid getan hat einerseits konnte ich die anderen verstehen aber einerseits wollte ich einfach das sie ihn akzeptieren. Außerdem hat es einige Interessante Entwicklungen im laufe des Buches gegeben die wahrscheinlich dann im nächsten Teil eine rolle spielen. Hier war es ziemlich ruhig und manchmal hat es sich etwas gezogen dennoch bin ich ein Fan von Em und Creon und auch hier wieder hat es die Autorin geschafft mich mit denn beiden zu Begeistern. Im ganzen würde ich sagen das wir langsam immer näher dem Krieg kommen und ich gespannt bin was mich erwartet. Ab und zu habe ich zwar etwas gebraucht in die Geschichte zu finden aber dennoch mochte ich auch hier wieder die Charaktere und die Liebesgeschichte und fand es spannend mal die anderen besser kennenzulernen. Ich kann es kaum abwarten was mich noch erwartet und kann euch nur ans Herz legen liest die Geschichte von Em & Creon glaubt mir ihr wird sie lieben.\n",

And you have no idea what it will be like! Well I am sooooo glad I did with Lisette Marshall! After that first read, I promptly HAD to get every book she's written. Which I have. All of which I've enjoyed immensely. And with each book I read, my utter love for this author and her work grew and grew and grew... she's an instant one click for me. And yes, she does write steamy books but all these scenes are beautifully tender and delicious! Creon must be one of my favourite characters. I admit, I do have a thing for \"bad boys\" and he's the ultimate good bad boy! Why do I say good? Welllll, he's had a really sh**ty past, a heck of a long past, which he's trying to atone for. The activities that he performed were forced upon him, he had no say or option but to do the bidding of his heinous mother and did what he could to find loopholes. Loopholes that affected him in the most awful manner. He's a character that evokes so many emotions in me, I honestly just want to fold him in my arms and love him. He and Emelin have the most stunning connection, one fraught with secrecy, no one must know scenario, he's the \"enemy\" and she's the \"saviour\" but goodness me, this is a relationship made in heaven! The love they feel, the emotions they experience, is absolutely divine! Even though Em hasn't gotten over herself and tries to appease everyone, the patience he has with her and her insane compulsion to keep them secret, is a testament of true love. I could sing Creon's praises forever but I wouldn't have enough space...The Mother, remember the heinous mother? Well, she's becoming stronger, the bindings becoming more common and the only hope the rebels have is to find the elusive gods, to beg them for help. Which puts Emelin and Creon is a predicament, save the world or save their fledgling love for each other. Tough one, tough call. But goodness me, not only is Em desperate to break the bindings I AM! I need to hear Creon, really hear him. Em's encounter with Zera was beautiful! Zera is sheer delight! I adored her! Her calmness, her reasoning, her entire being exudes calmness, dignity and all round niceness, just lovely. And thanks to her, Em's magical ability goes up a notch or ten. And oh my word did I giggle when Alyra made her appearance! If a bird could be called snarky, she's got it down pat!This book and series has left a mark on my soul, it has everything to make it a book and series I will keep close to my heart, one I will no doubt reread countless times. Such an intricately woven tale of deception, of secrets, of bias, of misconceptions, of greed and dominance but also a tale of finding oneself, of love and a conviction that love can indeed conquer all. The next edition couldn't come fast enough for me!\n",

Every book in the Fae Isles series has been a five-star read for me, and each book peels back more layers to the characters, develops complex new problems to solve, and shows immense character growth.  This book starts right back where we left off with book 2, and it’s a slow burn through the first half. I was not bored for one second, tho. It was deep and touching and pulled the reader through the emotions and fears of each character. I absolutely loved our FMC Emelin. I’ve read some readers say she regressed from her former level of confidence and became uncertain and weak. I completely disagree! Em has more responsibilities and power placed on her than ever before. She must make world-altering decisions that could affect the lives of thousands. And she’s 20 years old and grappling with being in love while overcoming a lifetime of trauma-induced insecurities. I found her to be immensely relatable, emotionally mature, and selfless. I loved her! I loved her anxieties, her fears, and the way she communicated openly with Creon about her struggles. I loved how she grew in her understanding of grief and empathy. Masterful!  And can we just take a second to talk about our MMC? He was beyond perfect. He was powerful, loyal, patient, and would destroy himself to protect the ones he cared about…and even ones he didn’t. So often in fantasy novels these days the MMC plays second fiddle to everything the FMC does; he becomes subject to her every whim, apologizes for everything that happens, and worships everything about her, as if she were some all-powerful perfect goddess. Blegh. How boring and unfulfilling. But Creon pushes Em to be the best version of herself. He clearly loves her, and that means growing a spine and speaking truth to her as well. At the end, he forces Em to make what should be an incredibly easy choice, and I was cheering for him. You tell her, Creon!! Way to be the strong male lead!! Because they are truly partners in this fight, they have each other’s backs, and as a certain favorite character of mine said, “Love doesn’t like to be taken for granted.” It was beautiful and perfect.  But that cliffhanger ending!!! I am deceased!! The final line of the book was everything we readers could have wanted! But it was agonizingly brief, and now we have to wait an eternity for the conclusion!!! Please write quickly Lisette Marshall!! This series has me completely hooked!\n",

Why are you pretending you don't know me? O, well I know I told you to do EXACTLY that but why are you being so thorough? Why aren't you looking at me? No, we have to hide even looking at each other. Don't walk too close. Don't breath near me. Why, o why are you ignoring me? Are you mad at me? Please talk to me. But don't talk to me cuz it's still a secret. Don't be mad. Are you mad? Are you ignoring me cuz you're mad? Please talk to me. But not now. Not where anyone can see. Are you mad? Why aren't you looking at me? So...yea, that was about 300 pages of that. AD NAUSEUM. Non stop. Then they'd maybe kiss or have sex. And also the Zera quote, don't take love for granted. That was repeated about 4-5 times during these stupid moments when em would tell Creon to hide their feelings from everyone, then she'd say to herself it wasn't meant for her. Cuz she DID love him. She just can't let people be mad at her. 🙄 I don't get it. EVERY. SINGLE. BEING, magical and human literally NEEDS Emelin, her power, Creon, and his power, to win against the mother. TOGETHER they are practically invincible. But they would keep them apart? Not even care if Emelin or Creon have an opinion. They'd boss those 2 around, use them as pawns to save the world...Yet emelin feels the need to not make them mad? To let them tell her what to do? Shit, her and Creon need to just turn the mother to dust, go pick an island and live happily ever after. Why are the 2 MOST POWERFUL beings of all, being bossed around by lesser beings THAT DEPEND ON THEM to actually survive? 🤔 Emelin I can kinda understand, she is slightly pathetic and needy. Which is unfortunate, I'd thought by now shed at least gain a sliver of confidence. But Creon allowing it to happen? He's been with Em for what? A few months, and yes she has taught him to show his humanity, but he is still a prick and vain and quick to slaughter. But he just allows EVERYONE to push him around? I get that he isn't what they all think he was..but he still kinda is...just cuz he wants gleefully embracing the brutal torture he was forced to inflict on the innocent, he still easily and gleefully will wipe out anyone against him and emelin(and by default, the alliance). But he's totally fine with being treated as dirt, threatened on the daily, and o btw, all by people he SACRIFICED HIS VOICE FOR? GTFOH. I call 🐂💩 on that entire plot.\n",

I’m utterly surprised to say, I think this might be my favourite installment in the series thus far. (I say surprised because it’s always strange to me when I love a sequel more than the first book in a series I love). Perhaps one of my favourite things (besides Creon obviously) was getting to experience more of the “side characters” so to speak. While this series very much started with a focus on Emelin and Creon, there are a number of characters that have since been introduced that have grown so much with the series that I would have been so disappointed not to get more time with them. I was genuinely so happy when a fairly large group of them set off on their quest together because I didn’t want to see them left behind. I was not disappointed. The found family trope is top tier in this book and I so madly love how much they genuinely care for one another with everything they go through together. And never thought I would love Edored and his bond with Emelin as much as I now do. I will say I was so incredibly frustrated with Emelin and how she managed herself with Creon. However, I felt this was reasonably explained and really worked towards Emelin’s growth and past trauma which opened my eyes a little to her experiences. Regardless, I will say I was so crazy anxious about their relationship for so much of this book between miscommunications and people getting in the way of the two of them with their unneeded, yet good intentions. Creon. Ohh Creon. I love this Fae so much. My absolute favourite thing about him has to be the fact that he is a straight up drama queen. I live for how dramatic he can be, even with hand signs (and writing) as his only voice. My love for him just keeps growing every book and the only thing missing is chapters from his point of view. The ending. My lord that ending. It gave me such chills and quite honestly made me tear up. I don’t even know how to wait for the next book with how things left off. I absolutely need more. I highly recommend checking out this series for the fantasy fans out there! This series just continues to get better with each book and the characters just keep growing and taking a little more of my heart the more time I spend with them. Start the Fae Isles series today if you haven’t already! If you have, prepare yourself for a wild ride with Ruins of Sea and Souls.\n",

Fuck Tared and his rebellion and the alves and the whole plot was just Tared being a dick.Actual review:Ok so to start, I still am obsessed with this series and these characters. I am desperate for the next book. However, I didn’t *like* this book. Let me explain. The entire book felt like it could have been cut in half. The first 60% is Em feeling insecure about her place in this rebellion and her relationship with Creon, and Tared and the rest of this group being generally assholes to her and Creon. Like that’s it, that’s the plot. So, that’s why I didn’t like it. The whole dynamic of the rebellion group feels like the author wants a found family trope real bad. But honestly I get no found family vibes—only frustrated with how they belittle everyone around them, including their own “members.” Like show me one person Tared and Lyn actually care about and treat decently. One person. YOU CANT. Man they even suck to each other. I think this is the ultimate failing here: we are supposed to feel conflict WITH Em about how she feels like she has to choose between people that she loves, Creon or Tared. BUT I don’t have any conflict at all because I think Tared sucks ass (and the rest of the rebels) so to me her indecision makes me think less of her. And I don’t think that was the goal. Now, I still love her and I get why she’s feeling insecure. I do. Everyone around her in her past has made her feel less than, and now the people currently around her do the same. Which, again, makes me angry at the rebels and kills any “found family” that might have been there. But girl was DENSE in this book. She had a freaking goddess tell her to be nice to Creon and she just goes “no lol he’s fine we talked about it a week ago and he said he hated it, there’s no problem” LIKE ARE YOU FOR REAL EMELIN?! The brain, use it. Creon—poor baby. No sarcasm, actual poor baby. He deserves better from EVERY SINGLE HYPOCRITE IN THESE BOOKS. Top of the list? Agenor, Tared, Lyn, and Em. Jesus. I think you can tell my level of frustration ☺️ There is a mean mean mean cliffhanger. Sexy scenes: lots of them but tbh I skimmed them cause the timing always felt wrong or I was mad they were having sec instead of TALKING ABOUT THEIR ISSUES.\n",

I felt like WAY too much time was spent on Emelin being an absolute asshole when it came to her relationship— that shit shoulda been nipped in the butt within a chapter or 2, the fact that it was the majority of the book was INFURIATING. And listen, I know that after centuries of perceiving someone a certain way would be hard to undo but damn, the way that Creon has been treated thus far has been very upsetting for me. Like damn, how many times do you have to be shown that you were wrong before you finally start to think better of someone?! I like to think I would give people more grace, and give them even just one more chance, especially after I’ve been shown multiple ways in which I was wrong about them, but almost no one in the Alliance is doing that. Em is so focused on keeping the peace with these people that she forgets are using her for who she is, that she is blind to the fact that what (she thinks) they are asking of her is completely unfair. And as far as I’m concerned the only person from the very beginning that has been on her side has been Creon but she was so willing to forsake him and take him for granted cause she kept allowing her opinion of him to be swayed. Kept allowing these people that are supposed to be her new family to treat her like she’s a naive child that couldn’t possibly be trusted with anything important. And I’m fully aware that in many ways she is, but not in the ways they believe.I’m also not saying that Creom was fully in the right during most of his confrontations with the members of the Alliance, but as far as I’m concerned, he is more right than they are. And the fact that time and time again he stood by and took the crap for Em and the sake of the mission is very telling to me. Except obviously the 4 weeks in the last book when he ran away. The only reason why I’m not leaving the story right here is because of the last 50 or so pages. I love that Creon finally put his foot down (sort of) and I love that it seems like Em is finally seeing the error of her ways and choosing the one person who continually chooses her.Anyways, this is probably a terrible review grammatically, but i needed to get it out and don’t really feel like going back to fix anything. If you’ve made it this far I’m sure you get my drift.\n",

It annoyed me to no end. While I understand why she was keeping it a secret, there was no need to stretch it for so long. The writer stretched it like a rubber band. I wanted to chuck my reader across the room and fly across the world to shake the writer and ask her why did she have to stretch this so much. All my favorite characters (Tared, Agenor, Edored etc) were being stupid as hell as well. Tared's explanation in the end for his behavior seemed childish to me. Not once did we get any implication that Lyn and Creon were even *remotely* interested in each other. But tared HAD to assume such things. While I understand how hard it is for him, it still doesn't excuse his dumb assumptions. The whole book I was feeling frustrated over everything. It felt like the plot to an Indian drama (if you know, you know). There was supposed to be a whole war going on but the writer barely paid any attention to it. The writing felt indecisive to me like the writer couldn't decide wether to make romance the main plot or the war. Because you can't have both unless you are a top notch experienced writer. And even then it's hard to write with two min plots. I really hope the next book is less frustrating because I really want some good books to come. My luck is bad nowadays and it seems I've read all the good books because I can't find a single 5 star book for myself.Good Aspects:Banter between the MC's was refreshing. Emelins decision in the end was *chefs kiss*. The whole colour magic theory is interesting and the softness smoothness factors really interested me. The gradual development of relation between Creon and emelin was butterflies-in-the-stomacg inducing for me. The fight at the nymph island seemed well written to me (even if two people defeating a whole army seems childish and unrealistic).\n",

I love the way that each book is like a little standalone, all coming together to as pieces of a larger puzzle. The settings are amazing in this series, and in this book we get to visit the plague ridden continent, and discover Zera's temple. We also get to meet the Goddess herself, giving us another brilliant character which leads us to the introduction of small, furry friend for Em. Just like the labyrinth, Zera's island is almost like a character itself and I love how the author has woven the places of this world into our hearts, in the same way that she has done the characters.I did feel some frustration with this book. I was beginning to become irritated with the secrecy of Em and Creon's relationship, particularly when it had begun before she had met or formed familial relationships with any of the people from whom it is being kept a secret. Let me make clear though, this is not a criticism of the story or the writing, rather that I was so invested with the lives of these characters, I was feeling the same frustrations that I imagined they must have felt themselves. I was incredibly happy when, inevitably, everything was out in the open despite the fallout it caused. This third book again ended on a satisfying cliffhanger. I say this because, as in each of the other books, the particular adventure for that instalment was concluded, while leaving it ready to begin the next stage of their quest. This was by far the best ending so far, and I am super happy that the final book has just released. That means, just like I am doing, you can binge the whole series in one go.\n",

There didn’t feel like a strong arc to this, things kind of went on and on, but in a way that felt a little un-driven. The same thing, of her pushing Creon away, wondering if he could deal (he obviously couldn’t), but then not properly ever addressing it… Like her goddess legit told her it was a problem, and then like twenty times afterward she kept making the same choice and worrying about making that choice. What gives dude? It got a little much. I feel like there needed to be a more compelling drive behind her actions. The reasons always felt not dire enough to easily be overcome, and that in turn sort of made Evelyn seem different to the person we’ve known in the first two books. Then she pulled it together by the end, but I guess the general thrust of this story just didn’t feel solid. I kind of wish this had been majorly shortened and included in another books? I don’t know. Like I said- the storyline arc if this felt unbalanced. I liked when they were in the forest, but then they were in a Nymph island, they had started at her dad’s place, then at the castle. I get that it made sense for them to go place to place, but somehow the world building felt loose or something. Rushing around, filling in gaps? I dunno. Felt a little bit like a filler book. Still giving it four stars, so this was not disliked, but J wanted more and I’m excited to hopefully get that in the next book. Also… I knew the ending would be something like that, but also, it pissed me off because can this fae not get a break?!!\n",

Did you truly think that would end well?”With war looming, Emelin’s plan is simple: break the Mother’s bindings while her more diplomacy-minded friends persuade the rest of the world to join their rebellion. Unfortunately, their would-be allies are far too concerned about Em’s exact connection to the feared and hated Silent Death. They might risk their lives for the world’s only unbound mage, but they’ll never fight for a fae prince’s puppet. Forced to hide the explosive secret of their love, Em and Creon journey to the plague-cursed continent to learn more about the bindings.I LOVED this one so damn much!! This has got to be one of my favourite fantasy worlds. This book had me smiling, gasping, crying, blushing, and stressed out as fuck. Basically I loved every moment of it. And the journey our misfit characters take to discover more about the bindings is very reminiscent of the Fellowship, and I am so here for it! This is also the book where we finally see Em come into her powers and discover who she really is and more importantly what she’s capable of.“He was here. He was mine. We’d take on the whole damn world if we had to, and who was going to stop us as long as we were together?”Now Creon and Em.

He is honestly one of the most well-written MMC's I've ever read, if not THE most. He is so fleshed out and has so much depth, his back story is incredible, and his character arc and development are absolute *chef's kiss*. I just want to wrap him up in a big hug and never let go!Em went through so much inner turmoil in this book and honestly, I was about ready to reach into the book and shake some sense into her. Don't get me wrong, her feelings were completely justified and I understood where she was coming from, but still! By the end though she came to her senses and I was in tears! She made so much progress. AND THAT ENDING!!! THE CLIFFHANGER! I'm dying and my book hangover is so terrible. I'm going to be thinking about this for weeks to come. I predicted before I even started the book that this was how it was going to end, so I wasn't surprised but it hit me hard in the feels regardless. I really hope in the final installment the other characters start to see Creon for who he really is and that we have some development in those relationships. After three books of watching him deal with the entire world hating his guts and refusing to give him a chance, I'm ready for my boy to get some love and friendship (fingers crossed).

The relationship is one of the best things about the book, as it keeps being interesting.However, the FMC is ridiculously annoying in the way she handles her relationships. Her character development into someone worrying way to much and finding issues were there are none seems to be the sacrifice the author made to keep some tension in the romance. The magic system is still fun and keeps evolving in interesting ways. The spice is still very well written.The side characters are insanely bland and boring. The found family vibes still feel so forced. Edored is the only one who’s personality makes sense - Lynn and Tared somehow manage to be both boring and annoying. INaxi and Beyla bring nothing to the table.🤸🏻‍♀️ I’m giving this a 4 because:- Creon is a very well written character - the banter between creon and Emelin is A+- I’m committed to the romance - the magic system is unique and interesting - the writing is good, apart from still overusing “oh gods” and “oh” - the spice is very well written 🤷🏻‍♀️ It is actually a 3,5 because:- the side characters are badly done - the FMCS inner monologues and rationale are bad - too little happened to forward the overall plot - the stakes felt very low, low consequences\n",

Uma das maiores qualidades da saga é construção de personagens apaixonantes, como o Creon, o protagonista masculino, que se revela extremamente carismático e também quanto mais se é revelado sobre o lado \"humano\" dele, mais eu empatizo e me apaixono. Além da protagonista, Emelin, que tem a necessidade de agradar todos e um medo de decepcionar aqueles que fazem parte da família que ela encontrou, e acompanhando tudo que ela passou durante a história e o passado dela, não tem como evitar compreender o porquê das atitudes dela e torcer para tudo dar certo.O desenvolvimento do relacionamento entre Creon e Emelin é um dos melhores pontos da história, já que autora conseguiu manter um equilíbrio perfeito entre tensão e amor, criando assim uma conexão profundamente realista e emocionalmente comovente.Adicionalmente, o livro possui uma rica gama de personagens secundários que desempenham papéis essenciais na trama. A dinâmica entre eles é envolvente, proporcionando uma mistura cativante de amor, ódio e drama que me manteve ansiosa por mais.A narrativa te leva em uma jornada emocional intensa, tendo momentos de surpresa, lágrimas e até estresse. Eu demorei um pouco para engatar no livro, mas quando engatei não consegui mais parar!! Eu adorei como a atitude da Emelin no final é resultado de todo o desenvolvimento que se vê durante a saga, e agora me sinto desesperada querendo o último livro da série urgente!!! 😭😭\n",

Overall, I would say it’s somewhere between a 3 and 4 star read for me. Being in Em’s head was absolutely insufferable for the first half. I ended up DNFing this book the first time I read it because I could not stand the constant repetition of Em’s indecisiveness and naivety that is thrown in the reader’s face constantly, and Tared’s overall asshole attitude was chafing on my nerves. But I am glad I gave it another go. The second half is much better. Truthfully I can relate to Em’s overwhelming feeling of inadequacy, wanting to be accepted, and people pleasing tendencies due to that, but it was a frustrating journey being in her mind while she went through the stages of overcoming her fear of displeasing everyone and shitting on Creon for 90% of the book. I really think this book could have benefited from dual POV to give the reader a break from her infuriating internal monologue. But once I finally saw the end in sight for Em’s change in mindset, I found the book to be enjoyable and the plot exciting. I still find Tared to be an annoying character, but I haven’t fully written him off. I also really wish they would stop making references to how Em is a child in Fae years, because it gives me the ick that several characters say that on more than one occasion and yet she is banging a centuries old male.The ending, while predictable, gives me hope for a really action packed, exciting next book.\n",

Being waiting for it since the I blasted through the first and second book. I even took a day off to stay home and read it. And yet! WHAT HAPPENED! How could it go this WRONG?!! Em used to have a spine, she used to be interesting, she used to be kick-ass and inspiring! Now she just give me 15-year-old-insecure-teenage-girl-energy. The whole book was her lamenting about her love life, keeping secrets, doubting herself, telling lies and treating her lover as some dirty secret. Had she broken up with Creon on the first page I would have been disappointed, but it would surely have been better than this toxic romance. And honestly, her friends are just as bad. They should all get their head out of their arse and start talking with each other like mature adults. It is telling that the only part I really liked about the book was when she was with Zera, away from Creon and the others. Her time in the woods came closets to the Em I used to love. Empathetic, head strong, reckless, and kind. Could I have that Em back please? The Em that stood up to her dad, the Em that forced Creon to communicate, the Em that almost killed the Mother? I saw glimpses of that Em on the fight outside the nymph isle, but generally the book really killed her character for me. Pls tell me that she fines her spine again and starts loving herself in the 4th book? I love the universe but this book was truly dissapointing.\n",

I could manage it if it was just part of the book, but it was the whole damn book. I do think we got a bit more depth from the characters, but not not very much (just more back story) because nearly every character was all so obsessed with Creon and Em’s relationship in some sort of way. For a bunch of ancient beings, they really need to grow up and mind their business. Also-keeping Lyn in a child’s body is just weird and gross. The Phoenix’ life cycles really should be addressed differently if they are going to be love objects. And I hope Em is finally moving past her rescue complex - that was getting super annoying. Not nearly as annoying as Tared’s piss poor attitude though. He was really pissing me off most of the book. His motivations were so selfish and arrogant much of the time. I could get it, to some degree, if he was concerned about Lyn. But that wasn’t his worry. He was worried about his own potential grief and thinks everyone around him is obligated to live life based on his fears - to hell with their own happiness and goals. It was especially frustrating given just how many people (who’s opinion he trusted) told him he didn’t need to worry but, heaven forbid, he listened to anyone else and accepted the reality that no one owes him their happiness. Otherwise, I liked the development of the world and magic system. I like that Em and Creon work together and support each other and treat each other as equals. I think they rely a bit too much on sex to communicate and tend to get horny at the weirdest times (people are dying, we're covered in blood and other grossness, but I really want to bang!???). But, overall, I think this relationship has potential to grow and that there is a genuine connection. I also enjoy the writing and humor of the books and the dialogue is engaging (we need to retire the word “chuckle” though). As for the ending - of course the glass orb was always going to break. I am happy that Em made the choice she did. Creon deserved that just because he deserved it, but especially because Em had treated him pretty crappily much of this book. Definitely looking forward to the final book.\n",

All I could do was cheer when Creon chewed her out proper about half an hour before the closing chapter. Lawd that was probably the most satisfying moment in the whole series. 3.5 stars. Just slightly above average. But not by much. Better than the first and second I suppose…. More stuff HAPPENS, and Creon is less of an angsty emo manchild which itself is a serious improvement. These books are definitely more of a ROMANCE set in a fantasy world rather than a fantasy story that happens to have a romance. The focal point is the romance, and a ton of time is spent on the interpersonal politics and ups and downs of this little group - meanwhile sometimes the story feels like it’s reduced to an afterthought- “oh and also there’s some fantasy sh*t happening over there.” Also this is nitpicky, but everyone in these novels seems to learn sign language entirely too quickly. A few hours to teach other people to understand Creon? Gurrrl lmao. Come on now. Also The place where they finally arrive for the final showdown is a direct rip off the Department of Mysteries. Also IMAGINE MY SHOCK when I came upon the last part of this book and suddenly realized that this ain’t all gone get resolved that fast and that…… no this is in fact NOT the last book in the series.

By the 90% mark I was kind of  over Em’s inability to make a damn decision. Or, rather, continuously making the  decision. I absolutely wanted to strangle her, I’m not gonna lie.Despite my frustrations, I still love these characters to bits. I relate to their struggles and failures and flaws, even if I disagree with their choices sometimes. A book doesn’t need to be perfect in every aspect for me so long as the characters feel real and human to me, which is definitely the case here.The middle portion of the book heavily discusses grief and life after tragedy, struggling to find your strength and understanding the pain of others, and it absolutely made me cry. This book gave me better life advice than any of my friends and family in the past year. The entire book series has always been very heavy on mental health topics and having the characters work through their issues (for better or for worse), which is something that I’ve really appreciated about these books, and  definitely didn’t disappoint in that aspect.Also—I cannot believe the ending did me like that, that was DIRTY.

Maybe they could have been if she hadn’t focused so much of this series on not just the action, magic and intrigue. Instead she chose to do something that you don’t often find in fantasy romance. She kept the focus on the evolving relationship between the two MCs. And she did it beautifully. I rarely find myself eagerly awaiting more than 3 books in a series. Honestly there are many series I’ve skipped completely bc I can’t guarantee I can pay attention to more than three books. This is an exception. I need to know what happens to Creon and Em. They could lose the entire battle against the mother and as long as they sneak off to a happy ending with just each other I’d still be satisfied. They are written so heartbreakingly broken. And struggle so hard as damaged people trying to love one another that what he poems between them is more important to me than saving the world. 5 stars and while the spice was less frequent than in the other books, it was definitely a case of quality over quantity .\n",

I was a little confused at first because I didn't really understand where the first chapter was picking up from, but persevered and all became clear quite soon!The first couple of chapters set this up to be a kind of journey book, and I'm not usually a fan of those but actually a lot of the focus is on the characters' interactions and the development of their relationships, both romantic and platonic which was really interesting.When you have an enemies to lovers/forbidden love trope it can get quite stale once they finally hook up, and although the way Em and Creon's relationship played out in this book wasn't groundbreaking, it was written really well and I was gripped with the story and my heart broke for them at every turn.My favourite thing about this book was Em's transformation from \"chosen one\" weapon to be pulled around as the rest of the alliance saw fit to an actual badass mage who made decisions for what she wants, knowing her worth and using that to her advantage, I really hope her character continues this growth through the next book!Creon, as always, continues to delight and surprise with his immense personality.

Emelin is carrying the weight of ALL THE THINGS on her shoulders and her decisions are hurting people but she’s trying so hard to keep everything together and make everyone happy. I struggled with this book because as much as I understood Emelin’s thought process, I also hated a particular choice she kept making and how she struggled with this choice for 553 pages of a 588 page book. It hurt my heart. The last 30 pages were fantastic and Em’s growth in this book, while painfully slow, was wonderful. There were also some really beautiful moments between the MCs that spoke to being yourself finding people who love you for who you are and no matter what. “‘I don’t just want you to know how I feel about you now. I want you to remember and feel the difference. I want you to realise in the very marrow of your bones that last time you showed yourself to the world, you became the world to someone.’”I love the quest-like feel of this book but felt like it had some pacing issues.

So much of this book is just Em doubting herself and making stupid decisions while hurting those she loves most. There is also hardly any battles leading up to this war and it just felt like the plot jumped around so much and also dragged a lot (like to the point I thought about DNFing several times). I love Creon and I really hate the way he is treated in this book, specifically by Em. Like yes, most of the underground does not like him but they also know that Em is on somewhat friendly terms with him otherwise she would not have rescued him but she does a complete 180 in her treatment of him and it's so sad to watch.There was a lot of comparison to character's actions or reactions to scorned children, I noticed this a bit in the first two books but I feel like it was just so over used in this one.

I hope that some things will be resolved in the next book (looking at you, Tared.) Anyways, fantastically written, gets better and better with each book. The magic system is super intriguing and so is the lore behind it. I wish I could pull from colors! If you enjoy romance, fae, spice, brooding men, action and more, I highly recommend this series! Can’t wait for the next book! Thank you Lisette Marshall for the e-arc of this incredible, pretty book!\n",

The world building and plot was so well done and the ending was perfect! The first half....well...I was tempted to DNF several times. There wasn't much happening in the beginning aside from the relationship issues/misunderstandings which seemed VERY contrived. FMC feels she has to hide her relationship with MMC so as not to disappoint/upset people? It just wasn't a believable conclusion for the FMC to come to, especially since she's supposed to be very intelligent. Even with her people pleasing tendencies it just felt so far fetched. The fact that MMC goes along with the charade for so long also seemed far fetched. And as I said there was not much else happening for the first half of the book. At the 50% mark it picked up though and I got into it enough to give it 4 stars. I kinda wish the series ended here, because the FMC and MMC are already in love and have been since the second book, it's basically just a fantasy at this point for me and not a fantasy romance, but I'm sure I'll read the next/last book when it comes out just for completeness sake.\n",

She finally drew a line in the sand at the end though and accepted that there was no way to have everyone get what they want. Self sacrifice is noble but not at the expense of all happiness. And it should be a choice, not an expectation. Some interpersonal relationships were fractured over perceived selfishness and a refusal to see beyond one’s expected worldview. While our MCs are in a better place and on more solid footing than they were for the entire book, I have a feeling that the found family will not come through this intact. I wonder if book four will bring us full circle to Em and Creon alone against the world? Emotions are messy and I love that every character we’ve met is flawed, but boy I’m sure it’s going to hurt when we get the reactions to Em’s decision. And I wonder if anyone will blame Naxi for making a decision rooted in the same motivations that drove Em which forced her to have to choose in the first place? Just because a decision is the smart or strategic choice certainly doesn’t guarantee that it is the right one.\n",

The 3rd book in this series was more about the FMC finding her voice (figuratively) while searching for her lover’s voice (literally). It was more about found family than it was about Em’s and Creon’s love story. If you are the person who is always trying to please everyone, this is totally relatable. Em struggles with keeping everyone happy, but also no wanting to let her loved ones down. At times, this was INCREDIBLY frustrating and seemed to drag on, but as soon as I put myself in the shoes of my younger self, I could see how this was so much harder for Em than people are giving her credit for. Yes, most of the action is the last few pages. Yes, there is a huge cliffhanger in the last lines. Yes, it is worth reading because the last book is going to be EPIC! Lisette hasn’t let us down and this series has become one of my favorites! There are so many good lines and special moments in this book for Em. This is her journey and this is exactly how it had to be in order for the fourth book to come our way!Lisette, I can’t wait!\n",

Mainly how the relationship between our MCs was being conducted. There was too much miscommunication for my taste (don't worry, it was not the main trope, but it was there). Also, the other characters need to keep to their business; our FMC is an adult, and it was really annoying how the other characters kept treating her like a naive girl who cannot possibly make her own decisions.Overall, I love this magic system and getting to understand and explore it even more together with the FMC.Again, let me say it: can we get the next book asap, because I need to read what happens after that last chapter.\n",

This book didn't need 580 pages. Too much time was spent on meaningless conversation, meals and glaring. We really didn't need 6 additional characters to tag along with the main characters. They were mostly annoying, we really didn't need them.We totally didn't need so much of Em's dithering about. In the previous book, she managed to break someone's nose 7 times for taunting her and convinced a 1000-year-old powerful fae to let her fight and release Creon. Here she seems to be reduced to a trembling, mumbling mess who's scared shitless that her friends would disapprove of her dating choices. I honestly didn't understand what so bad could happen if she just told her friends she's together with Creon. Like, what would they do? For some reason, Em is absolutely horrified by the prospect of being judged by her self-righteous besties, so she figures that letting them bully the person she supposedly loves and making him feel like she's ashamed of him is somehow better. I feel like she's not growing as a character, she's devolving. She probably should be isolated from the alves, their stupidity seems to be contagious.\n",

I wanted to shake her! Gah.And Creon. I still just love him with everything in me. We get a bit more of Em getting through to him and him fighting to be his true self but, it's a fight and she makes him retreat so easily by just being so ignorant which girl is NOT so it's baffling. He deserves the world and I truly hope he finds his voice (no pun intended lol) in the final book and actually lets himself be fully vulnerable around everyone else. His pain and trauma, his self loathing - breaks me every. time. And it drives me insane no one but, Em, Naxi and Lyn can see that.

I reached a point where I couldn’t tolerate the agonizing any more and I had to drop it a half star. Honestly, Emelin agonizes about going public with their relationship for so long that Creon can do better. She can either be open with everyone about their relationship or she can go fuck herself. #teamCreon If these men talked down to me and patronized me and mansplained to me half as much as they do to Emelin, I’d murder them.

The same goes with her romance. The care that Creon holds for Emelin is so gentle and feels real. The hardships they go through don’t feel blown out of proportion for their situation, but instead feel once again realistic and believable .

So many names and places to keep up with, without it feeling cohesive and absorbable. When this book began, I had a very difficult time remembering who each character was. Of course I remember the main characters and their general back stories, but it felt like there was an excessive amount of side characters with equally complex back stories and relationships. I feel like there are plenty of books I’ve read with complex plots and a large number of characters with deep, entangled backstories that don’t feel this way.

Their quests and missions are so interesting and with each book we learn more about this universe.

Especially regarding emotional intelligence, empathy, vulnerability, motivation, internalizing and externalizing emotions, support that allows choice, and how to practise self love. Ignoring the intricacies of the side character, it’s remarkable how the author is able to create the complexities that comes from two very different psychologically different perspectives in a way that feels real. I feel like I’ve met these characters in real life.\n",

I am, however, invested in the story and the characters so I will keep reading. Emelin has started to become annoying as a main character...her absolute refusal to come clean with everyone about Creon is getting old...way too many pages wasted going back and forth about why she can't tell them or what might happen, etc. She does start to make a turn at the end of this book, though. I loved the central plot of going to the Plague ravaged Continet to find a God to help break the bindings, not knowing if any of the Gods are still alive...and everything that happens there is quite good. The spicy scenes and battle scenes are excellent, and while it falls under more world building, the expansion of colour magic was also quite clever. I'm hoping the next book has less talking and more action though!\n",

I was fascinated with the whole color magic idea in the first few books, but this book blew it out of the water with the new ideas and extensions to the magic structure of this fae universe.

First of all, I still have no idea why Em can't just tell people that she is with Creon. It doesn't make sense to me in the grander story. They already think she is a \"fae mistress\" so why try to combat that by saying \"no I'm not... see! we're just friends!\" instead of showing how capable she is with her magic and how much Creon has prepared her for this road ahead? It just seems like a mountain out of a mole hill to add drama to the story and drag it out. Maybe I'm not made for magic but the shift to \"surface magic\" throws me off too..... color magic I could at least visualize but texture magic.... it didn't hit the bullseye for me.The last line broke my heart- shattered it!!!!!

Emelin made loads of stupid decisions and Creon suffered throughout the entire book. I’m really not a fan of miscommunication tropes and characters being dense until the very last bit of the bookOn the other hand, there were plenty of interesting things that happened throughout the book, like the gods and the new magic. The book is great in that aspect, but personally I was ready to kill half of the character cast and couldn't get truly excited about all the new discoveries.Making a cast of annoying main characters, which are the ones we are supposed to root for, really isn't helping the book. The only character I wanted to see get through this was Creon and it was really painful watching him get the short end of the stick the entire book.\n",

And Tared was borderline unbearable - his character annoyed me so much. And while I also understood Em’s concerns and the pressure she was under, I felt her waffling dragged on too long. HOWEVER - despite all this I still stayed up to 1 am binge reading it 😂 Creon and Em’s romance is still top notch, the plot, while at times slow, still had me interested the whole way through, and that last chapter had me screaming, crying, throwing up.

I read some reviews that mentioned character development and there just wasn’t any. I get it, she’s young and naive and her priorities are a little skewed, but at three books in she should have evolved to a more decisive and stronger character.

It can be terrible writing, and I’d muck it right up!! I really really liked the first two books, and was so excited to see where book three took us…. It took us into 500 pages of the lead female being whiny, indecisive, treating her fae love like scum (then being mad at him for avoiding her!). Only during the last 30 pages of the book did she grow a backbone and get a grip on her BS. If the plot needed those things to build her character, fine. But, I did not need 470 pages of it. A chapter or two at best could have covered what I believe the author was trying to accomplish. All it did for me was make me loathe Tared and Emelin.

I appreciate that his past is still there to haunt him, that Em has to learn to deal with this. I appreciate the way the author deals with long lived characters, not just glossing over the fact that people are hundreds of years older than the main character.I did get bored with Em’s vacillating in this book - I wanted to shake her at times and tell her to stop being a child. That may have been the point, but I think the same idea could’ve been conveyed without making me want to drop the book at times.

In her head, I was very much connected to her soul in a way, experiencing her fear, anxiety, anticipation, desperation, love, yarning and dread about the current and future situation.

Around 40% in, I was wondering why nothing was happening! Its a very slow start, so beware! Things do pick up and of course the writing and character development is amazing. But if you're waiting to finish this series, I would suggest reading this book when book 4 comes out. No resolutions here folks! A good read nonetheless, with spice and adventure and battles, plus all the fae magic fantasy readers like me enjoy.\n",

I loved the pace of this book and the world building. Only part of the pacing I did not like was the temple after the forest. Dragged a little bit, but it was doable. I devoured this book in a day and a half. The relationship between Creon and Em gets complicated and you can see her age coming through, but she seems to handle herself in the end. Also that cliffhanger will leave you yelling for the next book!!! So excited.\n",

Em and Creon are up there for my favorite book couple, I love how strong they each are individually as characters. The spice in this is slow burn, but so good! Warning though- mean, mean cliffhanger.

Hope the next book helps the other characters see that Creon isn’t all that bad as they make him to be and he has changed since they’ve last known him and hopefully Emelin becomes more upfront instead of worrying about unsolicited opinion.

Maybe if the plot was more complicated? The characters more diverse? Quicker pace in the storyline? No matter how hard I try I can’t put my finger on what makes this book not 5 stars. Maybe it’s the overall story? I have no idea.Would I recommend this to people who want a easy fun, loving Romantasy book? Yes! Would I recommended it to someone who is trying to relive those feelings they had when reading ACOTAR or Fourth Wing? No.I think the series is the best enjoyed when you go into it having zero expectations. This isn’t to say it’s bad but I think you can enjoy it more when you allow it to guide you through its world.

As the female character she is in her head a lot and it can be very repetitious..to the point that I lose interest. The character provides details that if one was reading along one would know. She is warned and yet still makes the same “I am the only one to fix it” kind of problems. I look forward to the next book and how the story ends.

I wished so many times that Creon would leave her and save himself from all the hurt she was causing him.The fact that it took an ultimatum for her to realise how much she had hurt him even after a God told her what she’s doing was wrong felt typical for her. Trying to appease everyone else and not caring about the one person who loves her this deeply was so hurtful. More sentient places to love!

Em, Creon, and the band of rebels will be up to more shenanigans, and the majority of them have crazy love lives to sort out on top of trying to save the Isles from the Queens' reign of terror..I'm still screaming over the cliffhanger for so many reasons..I love this series so much! Marshall makes communicating the hero of the day, and tackles the havoc that deeply rooted self-doubt can wreak. Em and Creon struggle with themselves in such different ways, and I'm in love with the way they lift each other up even as they struggle to understand. She makes the struggle real, though.

First half of this book was a little slow for me, but it picked up and one revelation after another just made me respect the author so much for her mind. I can’t grasp how someone can come up with worlds and plans and plots like this, and I’m just grateful she shared it with the rest of us. So I’ll let that numb my pain a little bit as I wait for book four.\n",

This book is full of angst and anxiety and hurt feelings. Poor Em is put in such a difficult situation, but she's doing her best. In the end, I think she made a good decision. Creon is so devoted to Em, but his feelings are understandable. This book ended on a cliffhanger and I'm just dyyyying to read the next book.

Love the plot, and the spicy scenes are 🥵 🔥 . I’m impatiently waiting for book 4 - after 3 books of Creon having no voice, it’s really going to end on him ‘rasping’ her name.

Each book follows another couple and so they can be read as standalone. I accessed the series with my Kindle Unlimited membership. This is Gilmat and Julie's story. Julie Watson and her mother were referred to in several other books in the series and so I was familiar with her back story. Her mother was trying to marry her off to an eligible bachelor. Gilmat is mentioned as the ranch gardener and keeps to himself. Julie is kidnapped by his brothers and delivered to his doorstep. I think it is safe to say that the connection between the two is instantaneous and a romance is born. Because it is the final book in the series, Honey Phillips shows us when the townspeople arrive after the pass is open and the weddings that take place. I guess the 4-star is because I didn't really find them the most interesting of the couples, but I enjoyed how the author wraps up the series. Goodreads review published 28/04/23\n",

Or, at least, it  to move quicker--and, in a romance series where all the books are under 200 pages and the premise is alien brothers stealing women to be their brides, that's saying something.Page count-wise, technically it's longer than most of the other books in this series, but, as the finale, this makes sense. It incorporated not one, but  climaxes/confrontations, one of which I expected and the other one I did not.Anyway, it was all very well and satisfying, and I have to say that my own real disappointment is that we didn't get to explore Gilmat's powers in more detail. Like...you have this awesome guy who has all these abilities concerning plants, but then the book itself doesn't delve into any of these powers in too much detail, and, for me at least, I just wanted .The same applies to the love scenes as well, actually. These was lots o' smut, as per my usual rating, but...I dunno, I guess they just felt quick to me, much like the relationship development?Meh, anyway, time for my final rating of the series, from which one I liked the least to which one I like the best: just as this is the 7th book, it's also the one I like least from the series. As the reasons above go into, I felt that although it was a satisfying and sweet conclusion, I just never got to know Julie or Gilmat as much as I did some of the other couples, and in part this is because their story had to be balanced with the ending of the stories overall, so maybe there was a lot to fit in and the author had a limited word count? Anyway, it's the one I like least, but keep in mind that it's still a 5-star rating overall, so that's not to say that I dislike it for any reason. Because this one just follows the formula set up in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, I knew everything of what to expect, and it was just kind of the beginning series for me. Also, of the brothers, Artek is the closest one to just being a generic alien, I think, so there wasn't necessarily as much to distinguish him. His romance with Pearl was the more mature one of them all, as he and Pearl are the oldest of the couples, and I really felt that this story had a lot to do with healing past wounds as much as it did romance. It just felt like a smaller story in the larger scale of things, if that makes sense--especially since Callum  kidnap Pearl to be his bride. This was a romance that I think was burdened to come up with a \"misunderstanding and thinking one knows what is best, when really they don't\" plotline as the main conflict, especially since Drakkar himself seems pretty unbeatable and unmoved. He both acts it and possibly  the toughest of the brothers, and pairing him with Kitty puts him in a great protector role--for her heart, especially. The inclusion of little baby Lola was also cute. Although the least serious of his brothers, the youngest and all that, I felt that Benjar's story had a lot of heart to it, for all that it was lighthearted. I just liked Rose as a fiesty heroine in that she actually fought  against the whole getting kidnapped thing, and plus Benjar's backstory really resonated with me. Truthfully, I read this at the same time when watched Puss in Boots: The Last Wish for the first time, and for some reason I keep associating Benjar with Perrito from that film, even though one is feline-ish and one is a dog. Maybe because of their bright, cheery optimism? .........A Beauty and the Beast retelling, no? Endark as the half-Vultor (which I'm assuming is werewolf-inspired) and half-human alien, wanting so badly to claim his one true mate in Becky. It was just sweet how they fell for each other, and how Endark learned to embrace himself fully and NOT be so desperate to get a mate just so he \"calms the beast inside him\". I thought it was a sweet story, with some pretty tense moments at the end there! Yet another way of retelling Beauty and the Beast, this time with a hero who's physically scarred and therefore hides himself from the heroine. This was yet another healing story, but I liked how gradual it was and how both the heroine and the hero really had to work and fight for their love and to realize that it's worth it. From the get-go, I sensed that Frantor might be my favourite brother, and boy was I right! So, yeah, definitely loved this couple and the story resonated just right with me!Aaaaaaaand....that about concludes my ranking. Ciao!\n",

Gilmat a big lonely giant of a male with very special abilities who believed he was destined to be alone. Julie a woman who loves plants and learning and wanted to be a scholar, but whose mother wanted to run her life. When these to meet it truly is love at first sight and maybe touch 😘 as always the world building was terrific and these characters had such wonderful Chemistry. It was truly a beautifully told romance focused more on the characters and their developing relationship than anything else. I'm still smiling and sighing happily as I write this . Honey Phillips does an amazing job telling a beautiful story with characters you grow to care about. She tied up all of the loose threads that weaved through all 6 of the previous books and left a possible n hint of other things to come! Absolutely recommend this to anyone who just wants to read a wonderful sexy loved story! Chef's kiss💋💋💋💖🔥🔥💖💖🔥💖💖🔥💖🔥🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖💖🔥💖🔥💖💖🔥💖🔥🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥💖🔥🔥🔥\n",

Yes, she knew she was essentially kidnapped, but rather than sulk and isolate herself, she embraced Gilmat and his knowledge of the plants. She also embraced the feelings he stirred within her. After all, she knows she's only there for a limited amount of time since her mother would never let her go off on her own to kill her dreams of marrying her off to a rich man.While Julie may believe the skills Gilmat possess is amazing, he knows that he's the truth and the shame he brought upon himself and his people because he wasn't skilled enough. He's also appalled at his lack of control when him and Julie are intimate or even when he lets him mind wonder where she's concerned. They both knew that their time together was most likely limited. Julie's mother is on a mission to get her daughter back. But is Julie ready to put her foot down where her mother is concerned and fight for a future with the green giant with a heart of gold?.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n",

I get that Gilmat didn't abduct her, but still... It gets 3.5 stars from me, rounded up to 4 stars.This story had some steam, but also some sweet moments as Gilmat and Julie got to know each other. Since Julie was unhappy with her mother's plans for her, she wasn't really bothered by being abducted -- and she soon realized that Gilmat would never hurt her. I also really liked that Julie's interest in botany was a perfect complement to Gilmat's abilities.Gilmat was an interesting character, and his powers with plants were incredible. He thought he was defective, since his powers weren't strong enough to pass the tests he was given as a child -- but Julie soon showed him that was wrong. She showed him that he just needed love to inspire him and make his powers grow.I liked Julie, too, and liked that she was actually pleased to get away from her mother. She wasn't bothered by being abducted at all, especially when she realized her mother wouldn't be able to try and retrieve her for months. I did think, though, that her mother would have caused more trouble at the end, and that their relationship wouldn't have been so easy to repair.Overall, I liked this book. I did wish it had been a bit longer, to allow for more character development. I would have liked more backstory on both Gilmat and Julie.Other reviewers have noted that they dislike the covers on this book series, since they look like comic books. I'm not really a fan either -- but I suspect that was so that the alien men on the covers could look like they were described in the book. It would have been difficult, and possibly quite costly, to use actual male models and make them look like the aliens. I prefer comic book style covers to those where the models don't look like the descriptions of the characters in the books.My rating system is below.1 star -- Hated it, or did not finish. I usually only give this rating if some of the content is truly objectionable to me, like if one of the main characters does something really awful, and gets away with it.2 stars -- Didn't like it. This rating usually means that I thought the writing wasn't very good, the editing was terrible, I didn't like the characters, or it had other major flaws.3 stars -- I liked it, but had some minor issues with it. This rating means that there were minor editing issues, the story needed more character development, it was just too unrealistic, or had some other fairly minor issue. The majority of books I read get this rating – I do not consider it a bad rating.4 stars -- I liked it a lot. This is a high rating for me, and I rarely give a higher one.5 stars -- I loved it, and will probably read it again. Very few books are good enough to get this rating from me. The ones that do are usually classics.\n",

I like this one less than Book 1, which has the similar task of story plot and series plot set-up. For me, both these MCs were the least likeable set of the series, and the timeline felt a bit vague. The timeline thing is actually kind of a problem, because the plot hangs on how much time each couple gets to spend isolated together in a blizzard.Books 2-7 of the series are happening at more or less the exact same time, with deviations mostly kept to epilogues. Even having read five other books on this timeline, this book fails at giving the reader a sense of time. It makes FMC's declaration of love seem  out of the blue. There's also no emotional build up to it, so it falls pretty flat. This book, and the others in the series, has an odd combination of explicit and fade-to-black. The author uses \"cock,\" which is usually in the realm of spicier books than this one. But we get plenty of scenes (both in this book and the series) where it fades to black, like Thanks, I hate it.Something else I hate? The complete and total lack of description of alien peen across the series. MMC has a  he calls a \"stamen\" near his dick, and we never hear anything more about it than it can  It can WHAT!? And you're not going to describe it?? There's a whole scene with FMC giving MMC a handy while he sleeps (which... yikes), and we're not going to get ANYTHING better than a reference to a large vein?Ultimately, this book and this series will ask absolutely nothing of you. No thoughts, just vibes. Unfortunately, also not a lot of alien dick.\n",

The book had a wonderful mix of sweet, spice, real life issues, and feels. Gilmat is an alien scientist who has a special affinity with plants but the way he was raised left a lot of blank spots in his socialization. At the end of the long and pointless war, he and his six brothers in arms purchased a sprawling ranch and settled on the planet of Cresca. Julie is a human who lives in the nearby town. She is the daughter of a rich widow who is constantly trying to marry her off. She is quiet, loves books, knowledge, and plants and has no desire to be married. Two of Gilmat’s brothers misconstrue a human story to mean they should steal human brides and unbeknownst to Gilmat, they decide to get him a bride at the same time. Julie’s last memory is going to sleep in her bed before she woke up in Gilmat’s arms in his greenhouse/home. Despite Julie being drugged and kidnapped, this is not a dubcon or noncon situation. Gilmat and Julie’s relationship develops naturally as they both discover through experimentation what a romantic connection and relationship looks like. The story was well written and included witty dialogue, characters with dimension and an engaging storyline as shown through sweet moments, steamy scenes, alien physiology and cultures, loyal friends, painful pasts, fated mates, coincidences, danger, and laughs. I am sorry the series is ending. I will miss these brothers.\n",

So when she dreams of a huge alien male, covered in vines, smelling of earth and flowers she thinks she is dreaming. Only to wake up and find that she is not dreaming at all. She is really there on the Wainright farm with an alien plant scientist, of sorts. She should be terrified and running away but somehow she's not. She has a few ideas of her own to test out first. Gilmat should have perfect control over all plants. After all it is what his species is all about yet somehow he cannot command them as he should. He runs experiment after experiment and they just don't go as planned. They have some rather spectacular results after Benjar gifts him his own bride. She is stunning, she is not afraid of him and she wants to help him.

The heroine, Julia Watson 'Julie', is interested in science & botany, but her mother is only interested in her marrying well. The hero, giant green plant-like alien Gilmat, was abandoned by his people as defective & thinks he will always be alone.For me the romance was too short and the characters too superficial to really enjoy it. Having read the whole series, I did enjoy seeing all the characters resolve outstanding issues and get their HEA epilogue. However, I wish that didn't come at the cost of the romance in this book being quite so abbreviated. Death of bad guy by being literally ripped apart by plants, murder of another bad guy by claws, punch thrown. MF sex, M and F virgins, cock with 'stamen' filaments at base that can caress clit, use of vines to hold her - not quite bondage since they release at her will.\n",

One night he opens his door and his younger brother Benjar hands him a wrapped bundle. When he opens it he realizes that it’s a small human woman with golden hair. He knew right away that he wants to keep her. Julia Watson awakened to seeing Gilmat and she is surprisingly calm. Almost like she knows him. Her mother is a nasty harpy who wants her married off to someone Julia doesn’t like. She likes to spend her time in the conservatory of her home reading books.This was my least favorite of the series, I don’t know what it was, but I was not a fan of Julia. I felt like she was too sexually aggressive towards Gilmat, especially because she was supposed to be a virgin. Also Gilmat reminded me too much of Swamp Thing. Also this book bored me, and another book with a ton of kids at the end. Too many characters added in and it got me confused.\n",

He is so gentle except when he is protecting his bride, Julie. What he does to the plants is phenomenal. And what he does for Julie is even more impressive. Julie is of course the perfect bride for Gilmat. Strong , intelligent but also willing to \"experiment\". Love the experiments the did together.Action, steamy romance, mystery and of course a perfect HEA.We learn how they handle the snow melting and what happens when the townspeople come a calling.Also the threat with the Volture is resolved.

Gilmat's character design is super interesting--probably most interesting of all the aliens introduced in this series--but the lack of attention paid to him in previous books didn't do a great job of building up suspense.Julie was more of an issue for me; I just didn't buy her character or her motivations. The quickness with which the heroines in this series adapt to their circumstances has been a consistent annoyance for me, but with Julie, it felt most contrived. Possibly because she was so inexperienced, so young, so focused on scholarly pursuits, and so cloistered. The wrap-up of the Vultor plot and the kidnappings (tying in the traditional end to the Seven Brothers source material) happening in the same book was probably ill-advised, also. A cute little KU series, but certainly one that required significant suspension of disbelief, even more so than is common in the genre.\n",

The story does described the world and how the founder as well as residents fit into the larger world and throughout the series you find out more about the colony's history and the people in the town.This story focuses on how PTSD effects people in unsuspecting ways, with that being said in some aspects of the story I didn't like that it was portrayed that being with someone you care about would cure you without having to do the work around it.

I felt Gilmat was unique because his type of alien is more alien than most we have encountered. He's basically a plant man and that makes this quite the steamy book. IYKYK. Julie is one of the 7 kidnapped \"brides.\" Her specialty is botany, so I really felt like these two go together like peanut butter and jelly. Gilmat is super sweet with Julie and gives quite the swoon-worthy performance. He's huge, he's highly intelligent, and he's also a cinnamon roll. Perfect. Phillips really wraps up the series in a wonderful way at the end of this last book in the series. Thoroughly enjoyable! 4 stars!\n",

Julie was really bland as a character and didn’t have the spark the rest of the women had. Also she was way too calm about being stolen. Just saying, I think waking up in the arms of a plant man would make anyone a little nervous, but she was ready to “experiment” right away. Gilmat was a little too boring as well. I think they could have worked but not in this setting. I did like the plant element and how he was connected to them. However I found myself more interested in her mother’s reaction and the other couples- heck I would have enjoyed more time with Danny and learning how he was settling in on a ranch with aliens. The conflict was well done but took a little too long for me, which is weird to say since it’s not a long book. Again, I think Julie and Gilmat were a little too much alike and either had that fiery spirit that made it interesting to read about them. Also I think the mother was underused. She could have been a great counterbalance to Julie and Gilmat’s blandness. I think what saved this book, was seeing everyone at the end. I loved the epilogue! In the end, I liked the book, but unlike the rest of the series, I didn’t love the book.\n",
